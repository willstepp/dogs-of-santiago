The Dogs of Santiago Notes:

* The opposite of the pretentious is the *real*
* Wallow in the senses
* Do not shy away from the shadow
* Insignificant words, sentences, paragraphs, scenes, chapters leading to an ineffable significance
* Create a narrative pull so the story *moves*
* Nothing easy for him, ordeals piling on top of ordeals
* No memories or stories apart from dialogue
* Dreams happen as a matter of sequence, indistinguishable from reality
* A book is a deed, not a product
* "You are 37. It's your eyes. Your face is young, but there is a weariness in your eyes."
* No bon-mots, no clever turns-of-phrase
* Shower in the dark
* Trying to buy flowers, clerk shows him flour
* Don't hold anything back, ideas, emotions
* An artist whose art is silence, "The plague of our time is the proliferation of mass communication, so he has created a new artistic movement - *shutthefuckupism*. The only relevant theme an artist needs to communicate to this new world order is silence, our innate need for silence and contemplation, at more than any other time in history. So he's taken a vow of silence. He's on all the social media sites, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, SnapChat. You should follow him."
* Ending: Interview with Government Agent (female), discussion with psychiatrist, hotel room, restaurant, park - the beautiful surroundings, lying under the treetops, sunlight through the leaves, dogs sleeping in the sun, a feeling of sublime gratitude at being alive, unspoken but unmistaken.

Second Half: Opens with Interrogation. Says they found him in park. Says he knew what happened at The Clinic. Recounts his story up to then. Psychiatrist puts him back on medication. They give him a nice hotel room and put him on a flight back to the US. In his seat is a young three year old boy. They make friends.



Daily Notes:

He waits until 1830 and paces around, wonders if he should return to the hotel room. He asks the barista if he has seen Constanza, showing him the photograph. The barista nods yes and pulls out the store tablet. He looks something up and then shows Will it is a famous Chilean singer. Will takes the tablet and compares the photographs. He types her name into Google and looks at more photos, eventually finds the exact photo. He hands the tablet back to the barista and walks out. By then there is traffic from people going home. He wanders down the street, through vendors trying to sell him things, the photograph in his hand. He rips it up and throws it in the trash. He walks back to his hotel room, foregoes the metro, and eventually arrives. By then it is 19:30 and the sun is going down. He goes to his room, stands in the silence of it, but finds it unbearable. He gets online and writes Constanza an email, sending her a link to the actress. Then he walks out, keeps walking to Bellavista. Passes a park where people are kissing, where dogs are playing. Plaza Italia. Comes to an open area with a gigantic screen. They are showing a football game, Chile vs Brazil. There
