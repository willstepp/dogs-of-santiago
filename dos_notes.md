The Dogs of Santiago Notes:

* The opposite of the pretentious is the *real*
* Wallow in the senses
* Do not shy away from the shadow
* Insignificant words, sentences, paragraphs, scenes, chapters leading to an ineffable significance
* Create a narrative pull so the story *moves*
* Nothing easy for him, ordeals piling on top of ordeals
* No memories or stories apart from dialogue
* Dreams happen as a matter of sequence, indistinguishable from reality
* A book is a deed, not a product
* "You are 37. It's your eyes. Your face is young, but there is a weariness in your eyes."
* No bon-mots, no clever turns-of-phrase
* Shower in the dark
* Trying to buy flowers, clerk shows him flour
* Don't hold anything back, ideas, emotions
* An artist whose art is silence, "The plague of our time is the proliferation of mass communication, so he has created a new artistic movement - *shutthefuckupism*. The only relevant theme an artist needs to communicate to this new world order is silence, our innate need for silence and contemplation, at more than any other time in history. So he's taken a vow of silence."
* Ending: Interview with Government Agent (female), discussion with psychiatrist, hotel room, restaurant, park - the beautiful surroundings, lying under the treetops, sunlight through the leaves, dogs sleeping in the sun, a feeling of sublime gratitude at being alive, unspoken but unmistaken.

Day One:

Airport:
Walking down the cavernous empty space in the dead of morning, dark outside, lights, sleepwalking people, a wide opening with a  line of people a mile long, pulmonary embolism, balding guy, cannot understand the man (expects he would speak english), does not have ID, panics, has forgotten his bag somewhere, runs back frantically, he eventually finds it in the bathroom, a young kid going through it, he roughly pushes him into the wall without thinking, his heart pounding, he takes a xanax, goes back, is through for a visit, enters the section with baggage, is sniffed by a guard dog, find cheeze its, medicine, nothing else. He leaves the airport, a row of taxis, one of them speaks english, he gets in that cab, says take me to the hotel rivera. On the way he sees the mountains and the city, imagines he is on the mountain top, in the snow. Comes back, pulls out a photo of a young woman and looks at it.
