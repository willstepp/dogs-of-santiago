The Dogs of Santiago Notes:

* The opposite of the pretentious is the *real*
* Wallow in the senses
* Do not shy away from the shadow
* Insignificant words, sentences, paragraphs, scenes, chapters leading to an ineffable significance
* Theme: A strange, hostile world becomes warm and embracing
* Create a narrative pull so the story *moves*
* Nothing easy for him, ordeals piling on top of ordeals
* No memories or stories apart from dialogue
* Dreams happen as a matter of fact
* A book is deed, not a product
* "You are 37. It's your eyes. Your face is young, but there is a weariness in your eyes."
