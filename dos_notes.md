The Dogs of Santiago Notes:

* The opposite of the pretentious is the *real*
* Wallow in the senses
* Do not shy away from the shadow
* Insignificant words, sentences, paragraphs, scenes, chapters leading to an ineffable significance
* Create a narrative pull so the story *moves*
* Nothing easy for him, ordeals piling on top of ordeals
* No memories or stories apart from dialogue
* Dreams happen as a matter of sequence, indistinguishable from reality
* A book is a deed, not a product
* "You are 37. It's your eyes. Your face is young, but there is a weariness in your eyes."
* No bon-mots, no clever turns-of-phrase
* Shower in the dark
* Trying to buy flowers, clerk shows him flour
* Don't hold anything back, ideas, emotions
* An artist whose art is silence, "The plague of our time is the proliferation of mass communication, so he has created a new artistic movement - *shutthefuckupism*. The only relevant theme an artist needs to communicate to this new world order is silence, our innate need for silence and contemplation, at more than any other time in history. So he's taken a vow of silence. He's on all the social media sites, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, SnapChat. You should follow him."
* Ending: Interview with Government Agent (female), discussion with psychiatrist, hotel room, restaurant, park - the beautiful surroundings, lying under the treetops, sunlight through the leaves, dogs sleeping in the sun, a feeling of sublime gratitude at being alive, unspoken but unmistaken.

Daily Notes:

What is purpose of Fullbright scholar scene:

1) Establish Perros de Santiago, fringe political group
2) Establish anti-establishment thought process of MC
3) Start escalating drunken night (shots, pot, xanax)
4) Introduce Ben, who will act as his Virgil for the night, "You are on fire tonight!"

He walks into the California Cantina, orders a burger and a beer. Sitting there he gets caught up in the game. A man comes to the bar and leans over him to order a round of shots, Petron. He asks Will if he is American. Introduces himself as Ben. He is with a group of American students in the back, care to join? Will agrees and goes to the back with Ben. He is introduced to a group of Fullbright scholars, drunk. Ben, Jamie, Tristan, and Carlos. They are meeting up and are playing a game. Will joins in. The conversation drifts to the Santiago Dogs, privilege, the importance of action. They play darts and Jamie puts up the photo of the girl, they throw darts at it. She gives him advice about what to write her. He agrees. @ShutTheFuckUpIsm

Ben wants to go to to Plaza Italia, to watch the game on the giant screen, this is what starts the concern for the Perros de Santiago, a conversation of who they are, what they believe, are about. He gets online and writes Constanza an email, sending her a link to the actress. Then he walks out, keeps walking to Bellavista. Passes a park where people are kissing, where dogs are playing. Plaza Italia. Comes to an open area with a gigantic screen. They are showing a football game, Chile vs Brazil. There

He walks back to his hotel room, foregoes the metro, and eventually arrives. By then it is 19:30 and the sun is going down. He goes to his room, stands in the silence of it, but finds it unbearable.
