The Dogs of Santiago Notes:

* The opposite of the pretentious is the *real*
* Wallow in the senses
* Do not shy away from the shadow
* Insignificant words, sentences, paragraphs, scenes, chapters leading to an ineffable significance
* Create a narrative pull so the story *moves*
* Nothing easy for him, ordeals piling on top of ordeals
* No memories or stories apart from dialogue
* Dreams happen as a matter of sequence, indistinguishable from reality
* A book is a deed, not a product
* "You are 37. It's your eyes. Your face is young, but there is a weariness in your eyes."
* No bon-mots, no clever turns-of-phrase
* Shower in the dark
* Trying to buy flowers, clerk shows him flour
* Don't hold anything back, ideas, emotions
* An artist whose art is silence, "The plague of our time is the proliferation of mass communication, so he has created a new artistic movement - *shutthefuckupism*. The only relevant theme an artist needs to communicate to this new world order is silence, our innate need for silence and contemplation, at more than any other time in history. So he's taken a vow of silence. He's on all the social media sites, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, SnapChat. You should follow him."
* Ending: Interview with Government Agent (female), discussion with psychiatrist, hotel room, restaurant, park - the beautiful surroundings, lying under the treetops, sunlight through the leaves, dogs sleeping in the sun, a feeling of sublime gratitude at being alive, unspoken but unmistaken.
* Sees someone he thinks is Ben, does not recognize him

Daily Notes:

What is purpose of Fullbright scholar scene:

1) Establish Perros de Santiago, fringe political group
2) Establish anti-establishment thought process of MC
3) Start escalating drunken night (shots, pot, xanax)
4) Introduce Ben, who will act as his Virgil for the night, "You are on fire tonight!"

"El gato encima d una mesa!"

The conversation drifts to the Santiago Dogs, privilege, the importance of action.

Plaza Italia. Comes to an open area with a gigantic screen. They are showing a football game, Chile vs Brazil. There he joins in the excitement, trying to follow the game, getting angry when the crowd gets angry, shouting when the crowd shouts.

He walks back to his hotel room, foregoes the metro, and eventually arrives. By then it is 19:30 and the sun is going down. He goes to his room, stands in the silence of it, but finds it unbearable.

3300
1700 words in the conversation, regarding TBD

5000 (game + riot)
1700 mugging
1700 game
1700 riot

5000 (bellavista + valpon 9 + hotel)

Something happens to Will and Ben on the way, just a holdup with a knife, no beating, Ben's wallet is stolen. Will's Xanax is stolen, but they don't find his wallet. 

Then later, in the shanty town, its just a beating, but they take his wallet as well, break his ribs and wrist.

Will ends up beating someone during the riot

Floating in space, clinging to a rock, speeding up, then realizes there is no need to cling anymore. No consumption, no empathy, only silence. A planet for every girl and boy.

"Of the wise man, as of the foolish man, there is no memory for ever..." Ecclesiastes.

Ben shits his pants during the mugging. "I shit my pants. Fuck. I shit them."

"iPod. iPod. iPod. iPod. iPod!"
Network! Macbook Pro! Macbook Macbook Pro one thousand sixty inch display!"

"All they said was iPod and they took my phone and wallet."

What is the purpose of the scene tonight? To give a sense of the excitement, pride, and joyous ecstasy of watching a national soccer game, and how it slowly gets out of control. Drinking, punching but laughing, dancing, hot dogs, completes, uno cerveza por favor! Draw from the jumbotron night, the gate, the maze like nature of the crowd, the violence mixed with happiness. the confusion about the game. The girls. The clear night above it all. A family like an island. A boy on his father's shoulders. A businessman in a suit eating ice cream. Bring back the anxiety of being in a crowd, of feeling the pressure on the chest, the slight suffocation.

What happens now? 12-03-2013

The riots should span two writing sessions ~3000 words, and end with Will beaten, soaking wet, falling into the river from the bridge, walking down with the direction of the water, seeing people's clothes strung over the water, drying. Climbs out a few hundred miles down, walking the narrow alleys, until he emerges somewhere close to Bellavista. Disorientation, vivid detail, images without context, violence mixed with laughing.

Beginning of the riots, chaos, celebration turning into a stampede, up close to the carabineros. They push people to the ground. tear gas in the air. The dogs playing as if its just another day. Will gets away and runs down a side street with a pack of teenagers. There are people looking out the windows.

Will is in the crowd, celebrating the Chilean victory, although violence is creeping in, slowly. He feels swept along, picks up a chair himself and tosses it into a tree. Someone hands him a beer, there are shouts and songs. He joins in and screams about the cat on the table, having fun.
