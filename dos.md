THE DOGS OF SANTIAGO
by Daniel Stepp

Chapter One

As he stepped off the plane onto the retractable walkway between the exit door and the terminal gate, he felt a bitterly cold July wind whip in through one of the slits in the fabric joins. He weaved through the passengers, stumbling and bleary-eyed, and found his way to the nearest restroom, where he found some jeans he had brought just in case, and an old flannel shirt he kept tucked in a side pouch of his duffle. 

A fat man, Chilean, emerged from the last stall. He looked surprised to see a half-naked American there, but made no eye contact and walked straight out without a nod. The man pulled up his jeans and washed his face in the dirty sink. He looked in the mirror. The dim neon lights made him look older and more tired than he was. He never could sleep on a plane, or a bus, or any other place for that matter. Not without pills anyway. And he wanted to keep them for when it got bad again.

"Muchas gracias, se√±or," he greeted his reflection.

"De nada," he nodded to the mirror, and walked out.

Leaves his bag without realizing it. Stands in line for customs. Thinks about pulmonary embolism. When he gets to where he needs to show his ID, he realizes he left his bag, with his ID. Runs back. The bag is not there, a young man has it. Takes it from him violently. Dogs inspect the bag, find nothing. Scene.
