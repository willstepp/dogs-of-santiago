THE DOGS OF SANTIAGO
by Daniel Stepp

Chapter One

As he stepped off the plane onto the retractable walkway between the exit door and the terminal gate, he felt a bitterly cold July wind whip in through one of the slits in the fabric joins. He weaved through the passengers, stumbling and bleary-eyed, and found his way to the nearest restroom, where he found some jeans he had brought just in case, and an old flannel shirt he kept tucked in a side pouch of his duffle. 

A fat man, Chilean, emerged from the last stall. He looked surprised to see a half-naked American there, but made no eye contact and walked straight out without a nod. The man pulled up his jeans and washed his face in the dirty sink. He caught himself in the mirror. The dim neon lights shadowed his face with older and more tired lines. He never could sleep on a plane, or a bus, or any other place for that matter. Not without pills anyway. And he wanted to conserve them for when it got bad again.

"Muchas gracias, se√±or," he greeted his reflection.

"De nada," his reflection answered back.

It was a cavernous hallway, from the gates to customs, with brick-lined walls. It looked old here, a futuristic design from thirty years ago. Everything was dim, in half light. Above were skylights, but outside it was still early morning, the night sky lightening against the dark clouds. The floors shined. You could see fifty yards ahead. Down there, close to a row of doors was a janitor, slowly mopping. The man kept pace with the others, most sleepwalking without really knowing where they were headed. There were signs in Spanish, and arrows. He had downloaded a translator app before leaving, but did not feel the need to pull it out just now. There seemed only one way to go.

Remembering what he had read about long flights he moved his legs and ankles more than necessary as he walked, kicking up his heels ever so often. Get the blood flowing. He had not had much of a chance on the plane stretch his legs or get up and walk around, since he was on a window seat and there were others blocking him. He had a real fear of pulmonary embolism. You could be fine for a day, after a fourteen hour flight. Then suddenly you collapse as the clot that formed the day before as blood gathered in your ankles reaches your lungs. Maybe you are having dinner with business partners. Maybe you are dancing with a pretty girl you met that day. And now you were dead. It gave him chills, and he knew he could not fully let it go until maybe tomorrow, or the day after. He would keep thinking about it and wondering in the back of his mind, will I die now? He braced himself against the corridor wall and gave both legs a good stretch. Then kept walking.

Finally his group reached a vast room. It came suddenly, around a bend, and everyone woke up a little more. There were more signs and arrows, but they were not necessary because in the middle of the space was a line of people, winding through dividers. It was maybe hundreds. His heart sank. He felt the old dizziness come over him; the old pounding in the chest. He considered taking a Xanax and being done with it, but decided to wait. He took in a few deep breaths and followed the others to where the line ended.

If he focused on the breathing it wasn't so bad and after a few minutes he couldn't feel his heart pounding anymore, didn't feel dizzy. He felt composed and took in his surroundings. The line was moving fast. At this rate he would be through in another thirty minutes, not bad considering the volume of people. Behind  him now was a line of at least fifty people. This place was odd. It felt makeshift, although there were permanent kiosks set up at the end. All around them were closed stores. He saw a few signs in English, "Duty free!" and "Last chance!" He saw things he recognized which he found strange. A bag of Hershey's Kisses, a Harper's Bazaar magazine, the same stuffed bear he saw at Hartsfield Jackson.

In front of him was a balding man. He was with an attractive woman, blond, shapely. He wondered where they were from and thought about asking them, but decided it would be too awkward to keep up the conversation, too much trouble as he really didn't want to talk to anybody.

"Excuse me," he spoke to the blond, a little too enthusiastically.

"What do you need?" said the man. He put himself between the girl and the man. He sounded German, or Scandinavian.

"What time is it?"

The German pointed to a clock on the wall overhead and turned back around. He stared at his bald head and thought of his own thinning crown. One day his hair would be as bald as this guy's, for sure. The only difference was he would look ridiculous, this guy wore it well. He wondered if the girl had been with him before he was bald, or after. If only you could ask those kinds of questions. Scanning the rest of the crowd it will clear there were people from all over. By far the majority looked South American, but there were a lot of Europeans. Some Americans maybe, maybe Canadian. He kept his eye on an attractive woman a few bends ahead. Ever so often they would cross paths and he would briefly make eye contact. He smiled at her but she did not smile back.

At last he reached the end of the line where there was a small digital sign with red numbers, indicating which kiosk the next person in line should go to. His number flashed fifteen and he walked down to the end, where a customs officer in a dark gray uniform nodded to him. The officer seemed irritated and held out his hand. The man suddenly panicked when he realized he needed the customs paperwork he had filled out on the plane, as well as identification. He was not focused. He took in a deep breath and reached in his pocket but the papers were not there. He reached down for his duffle but the duffle was not there.

The officer said something to him in Spanish, made a gesture with his hand as if he was holding a card.

"I'm sorry," the man said, "do you speak English? I don't know Spanish. My bag is gone. Can I go get it? I need to go find it."

The officer shook his head and leaned back in his chair, looking over to a few kiosks down. He whistled and said someone's name. Another officer came over and spoke to him.

"Sir, where is your id and entry paperworks?"

"That's what I was saying, they're all in my duffle bag and I seemed to have misplaced it somewhere. Maybe on the plane. Can I go get it and return?"

"Sir, we need your identification."

"I know, I'll be right back. Sorry."

He retraced his path through the dividers, past what was by this point hundreds of people. His eyes were fixed on the ground, looking back and forth for his duffle bag. As he went his pace quicker and quickened until he was almost jogging. A young girl in a pink winter coat caught his eye and pointed at him. No sign of the back.

Once past the line of people he broke into a sprint into the corridor leading back to the gates. His heart beat loud in his chest. What would happen if he couldn't find his duffle. All his identification was in there. How could he have left it? Why didn't he pay more attention? He had fucked it all up already. It hadn't even begun and it was fucked up. As his panic increased so did he pace and by that point he was running down the corridor. On the right and left he passed people of all colors, shapes, and sizes, but could not take them in or even acknowledge their amazed looks. A loud whistle echoed from the far end of the corridor. He stopped and glanced back.

A guard with one hand on his mouth and the other on some kind of club gestured violently for him to slow down. The man nodded so the guard could see and resumed walking at a brisk pace.

Eventually he returned to the gates, saw the large numbers and the planes outside. As he passed the bathrooms he remembered going in there and stopped to look. Now there were lots of people but his bag was not there. He looked underneath the stalls and at the very end, he saw the familiar black leather strap dangling down. He went over to the stall and threw open the door.

A kid, maybe fifteen or sixteen was there, sifting through his bag. On the toilet paper rack he could see his checkbook, car keys, and earbuds. The kid was skinny, dressed like a punk, probably Chilean. Without thinking, the man grabbed him by the shirt, ripping it at the collar. He growled,

"What the fuck, man? What do you think you're doing with my stuff? That's my bag you're going through!"

The kid stammered something in Spanish and tried to break free. The man was about to let him go, but a wave of anger went through him and he shoved him hard into the toilet. The kid's back hit the side of the tank and he went down, grabbing himself with both hands. The man was immediately sorry but his anger was still high. He lunged at the kid and the kid scrambled under the stall opening and ran out.

Dizziness overcame him and he sat on the toilet and put his head in his hands. After a few minutes he collected himself and put his things back into the bag. He made sure his ID and paperwork was still there, and then took an itinerary of everything else he could remember bringing. It was all there. He took out his toiletries bag and unzipped it, popping two pills from an orange prescription bottle. He placed them on his tongue and went out to the sink. He turned on the faucet and cupped a handful of water into his mouth, swallowing the pills.

Then he returned to the stall and waited. It took half and hour or so for the Xanax to kick in, and when it did he felt the fear and dizziness subside. A heavy sense of peace and mellowness came over him. He could sleep here if he wanted, but got up and made his way back to customs. He was laughing about everything that happened and didn't even mind waiting in line for another hour. By this time it was eight in the morning and the place was brighter, his mood was brighter.

"Here, the paperwork and my ID," he handed his documents to another kiosk officer. This officer also did not speak much english. The officer nodded and wrote something down on the paper. He stamped his passport and gave it back to him, waving him through to the other side.

This place is like a maze, he thought, rounding another corner, not sure exactly where he was going, but following the general traffic of people. He smelled food somewhere, coffee, sausage, cinnamon rolls. He next entered a cavernous space, with high ceilings, baggage claim conveyers. A female voice came over the speakers in regular intervals spoke something in Spanish, in a calm voice. He found his flight number on the digital panels overhead and walked over to find his checked bag in a stack against the far wall. He wheeled it out and continued through the area, the space congested with crowds of families and businesspeople, couples and patrolling guards with guns in their holsters. He came to the back of a disorganized line, the end of which ended in a panicked crowd of travelers shoving their checked baggage through X-ray machines as officers inspected their contents on tiny monitors to the side.

A Frenchmen pushed into line ahead of him, subtly, using his cell phone conversation as a distraction. The man did not argue. He was not upset, the drugs at maximum effectiveness now. He was relaxed. He even felt proud of himself for not saying anything or reacting in outrage, although he might have only thirty minutes ago. Good stuff, he thought. Someday I have to quit.

As they approached the X-ray machines, a large German Shephard came nosing through the crowd, leading an officer by his leash. The dog sniffed at bags every now and then, sometimes stopping, but most of the time he continued without breaking a stride. When he reached the man's luggage he stopped and sniffed around for a few seconds and the man's gut dropped. Were his prescriptions legal to bring into the country? He really didn't know. Would they confiscate them, arrest him. So many fears went through his mind until the dog continued on his way. The man made eye contact with the dog's officer, who seemed preoccupied and did not return his nod.

He put his bag through the X-ray machine when it was time, and the rubber belt pulled it through the metal box. He watched it go through on the monitor and saw all his belongings in what looked like camera film negative. There was a green outline around the monitor screen, which he took as a good sign, until the officer who sat at the monitor pushed a button to stop the conveyor. A buzzer sounded and a few other officers looked around to see what was happening.

One came over and the other pointed out something to him. They both nodded and looked suspiciously at the man. Even with the sedatives in his system he was panicked and wondered what they had found. The other officer walked to the conveyor and pulled out his luggage. He unzipped it there in front of everyone, exposing his underwear, bag of q-tips, everything. He pushed everything to the side until he found an apple and a box of Cheez-Its. He pulled them out and tossed them into the trash. He then zipped up the luggage and gave the man an impatient glance, pointing to a sign which illustrated no food or produce. He gave a nod to the officer at the monitor who hit another button and the conveyor continued, this time without stopping. He was through.

He rode an escalator up to the main level into the general area of the airport. At the top he went through a crowd of expectant faces, each looking for some other face than his. The smell of food was stronger here and he had not eaten since the night before, so he decided to stop and grab something to eat before heading to the hotel. He found a coffee shop among a row of restaurants and stood in line there, pointing to a cherry danish in the glass and somehow communicating to the girl behind the counter he wanted a medium-sized mocha. He reached the counter and a man gave him the total in Spanish.

"Just take it out of this," he said, handing him the twenty from his wallet.

"No moneda Americano," the man said. He seemed agitated.

"No?"

"No," the man behind the counter repeated, and pointed down the walkway, making a gesture like exchange of money.

"Oh fuck, sorry man," the man said. He took back the twenty and pushed the coffee and danish back into the counter.

The exchange didn't open for another half hour, so the man sat on his bag against the desk. He was exhausted, hungry, and just wanted to get to the hotel so he could get some proper sleep before this afternoon. He took out his phone and checked to see if there was a signal (there wasn't) and then finished listening to a WTF with Marc Maron podcast he had started on the flight. Then he realized his battery was low so turned it off. As he sat there he remembered all his last-minute travel notes were written on the phone's notepad app. So he pulled his journal and pen from his duffle, turned back on the phone, and copied them down, just in case.

By then the exchange was opened, and he exchanged the rest of his pocket money, about a hundred and twenty dollars, for Chilean pesos. He looked at the strange, brightly colored money for a moment before stuffing it in his wallet. He returned to the coffee shop but there was a line so he said screw it and decided to head to the hotel instead.

Outside it was even colder than he remembered from this morning, overcast and windy. An old man was spraying down the walkway outside the automatic doors and some overspray him in the face. He gave the old man a nasty look and went down a ways to a line of yellow taxis, all the drivers leaned on their vehicles, waiting for customers.

"Hey man, need a lift?" one of the driver's said. He was the only one who spoke English so he gave him a nod and handed him his luggage. The driver jumped up, threw the luggage in the trunk and opened the door for the man. Once inside he asked, "Where would you like to go?" with such a strong accent and trouble articulating the words it was obvious he only knew enough English for business reasons. But it was enough.

"180 Miraflores, cross street with Moneda. Here," he handed him the notes he had jotted into his journal earlier, and pointed to the address.

"Ah, Hotel Riveria, si" The driver gave him a thumbs up, put down the fare flag, and took off.

Once far enough away, the man turned back and took in the entire airport. It was an impressive sight, the giant metal and glass structure, futuristic in that thirty year old way.

The driver weaved in and out of the traffic like a man on a mission. He made no attempt at small talk, but this was fine with him. It would have been impossible anyway. So instead, he looked out the window, a wave of relief coming over him. 

He had a moment of weakness back there, he had actually taken some Xanax. It had been a couple months since the last time. He knew it would be this way. And it was. He felt good. Thankfully he had done as his mother suggested and got the prescription filled the day he told her he was leaving. Just the Xanax and Ambien, short term stuff. No Lexapro, he didn't need a long-term solution, just a safety net. Fuck, why did he shove that poor kid? That kid probably had shit his pants. Hell, he nearly shit his. That was not him back there. Not him at all.

He saw outside the cars going by. Cars he did not recognize, smaller and older than those on the American highways. Inside were Chileans. Life here was the same as in the states. Going to work, going home. The buildings were the same, not exactly, but close enough. Old ones, shiny new ones. Dilapidated ones. Graffiti on the concrete overpass. In Spanish of course. Green signs in Spanish, roads, exits. The smells the same, gasoline, the crisp, almost metallic winter air. A gray light, overcast, maybe a little chance of rain. The people different, native, more ancient looking, shorter. He saw them walking on the sidewalks. 

Beyond the city he saw the mountains, the Andes. How far was it there, to those snowy peaks? He imagined the silence of that place in contrast to the noise down here. He was sitting there in the snow, cross-legged, he ankles exposed and freezing. The cold of the snow slowly coming through the bottom of his jeans. He shivered. The only sound here was the whipping of the wind around the crags. No life nor food. Only silence. This was no place for a human being.

He awoke still in the taxi, the driver stopped in construction traffic, frustrated and banging on the steering wheel. It was raining. Outside were people walking past, making better time than the cars. It took him a few moments to realize he was in Chile, took some time before the events of the morning came back to him. He reached into his duffle bag and pulled out his journal. Between two pages was a folded picture. He opened it and gazed at the dark-haired woman staring back at him. She was beautiful.
