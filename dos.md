THE DOGS OF SANTIAGO
by Daniel Stepp

Chapter One

As he stepped off the plane onto the walkway between the exit door and the terminal gate, he felt a bitterly cold July wind whip in through one of the slits in the fabric joins. He weaved through the passengers, stumbling and bleary-eyed, and found his way to the nearest restroom, where he found some jeans he had brought just in case, and an old flannel shirt he kept tucked in a side pouch of his duffle. 

A fat man, Chilean, emerged from the last stall. He looked surprised to see a half-naked American there, but made no eye contact and walked straight out without a nod. The man pulled up his jeans and washed his face in the dirty sink. He caught himself in the mirror. The dim neon lights shadowed his face with older and more tired lines. He never could sleep on a plane, or a bus, or any other place for that matter. Not without pills anyway. And he wanted to conserve them for when it got bad again.

"Muchas gracias, se√±or," he greeted his reflection.

"De nada," his reflection answered back.

It was a cavernous hallway, from the gates to customs, with brick-lined walls. It looked old here, a futuristic design from thirty years ago. Everything was dim, in half light. Above were skylights, but outside it was still early morning, the night sky lightening against the dark clouds. The floors shined. You could see fifty yards ahead. Down there, close to a row of doors was a janitor, slowly mopping. The man kept pace with the others, most sleepwalking without really knowing where they were headed. There were signs in Spanish, and arrows. He had downloaded a translator app before leaving, but did not feel the need to pull it out just now. There seemed only one way to go.

Remembering what he had read about long flights he moved his legs and ankles more than necessary as he walked, kicking up his heels ever so often. Get the blood flowing. He had not had much of a chance on the plane stretch his legs or get up and walk around, since he was on a window seat and there were others blocking him. He had a real fear of pulmonary embolism. You could be fine for a day, after a fourteen hour flight. Then suddenly you collapse as the clot that formed the day before as blood gathered in your ankles reaches your lungs. Maybe you are having dinner with business partners. Maybe you are dancing with a pretty girl you met that day. And now you were dead. It gave him chills, and he knew he could not fully let it go until maybe tomorrow, or the day after. He would keep thinking about it and wondering in the back of his mind, will I die now? He braced himself against the corridor wall and gave both legs a good stretch. Then kept walking.

Finally his group reached a vast room. It came suddenly, around a bend, and everyone woke up a little more. There were more signs and arrows, but they were not necessary because in the middle of the space was a line of people, winding through dividers. It was maybe hundreds. His heart sank. He felt the old dizziness come over him; the old pounding in the chest. He considered taking a Xanax and being done with it, but decided to wait. He took in a few deep breaths and followed the others to where the line ended.

If he focused on the breathing it wasn't so bad and after a few minutes he couldn't feel his heart pounding anymore, didn't feel dizzy. He felt composed and took in his surroundings. The line was moving fast. At this rate he would be through in another thirty minutes, not bad considering the volume of people. Behind  him now was a line of at least fifty people. This place was odd. It felt makeshift, although there were permanent kiosks set up at the end. All around them were closed stores. He saw a few signs in English, "Duty free!" and "Last chance!" He saw things he recognized which he found strange. A bag of Hershey's Kisses, a Harper's Bazaar magazine, the same stuffed bear he saw at Hartsfield Jackson.

In front of him was a balding man. He was with an attractive woman, blond, shapely. He wondered where they were from and thought about asking them, but decided it would be too awkward to keep up the conversation, too much trouble as he really didn't want to talk to anybody.

"Excuse me," he tapped the blonde on the shoulder.

"What do you need?" said the man. He put himself between the girl and the man and looked down. His accent was German, perhaps Scandinavian.

"What time is it?"

The German pointed to a clock on the wall overhead and turned back around. He stared at his bald head and thought of his own thinning crown. One day his hair would be as bald as this guy's, for sure. The only difference was he would look ridiculous, and this guy wore it well. He wondered if the girl had been with him before he was bald, or after. If only you could ask those kinds of questions. Scanning the rest of the crowd it will clear there were people from all over. By far the majority looked South American, but there were a lot of Europeans. Some Americans maybe, maybe Canadian. He kept his eye on an attractive woman a few bends ahead. Ever so often they would cross paths and he would briefly make eye contact. He smiled at her but she did not smile back.

At last he reached the end of the line where there was a small digital sign with red numbers, indicating which kiosk the next person in line should go to. His number flashed fifteen and he walked down to the end, where a customs officer in a dark gray uniform nodded to him. The officer seemed irritated and held out his hand. The man suddenly panicked when he realized he needed the customs paperwork he had filled out on the plane, as well as identification. He was not focused. He took in a deep breath and reached in his pocket but the papers were not there. He reached down for his duffle but the duffle was not there.

The officer said something to him in Spanish, made a gesture with his hand as if he was holding a card.

"I'm sorry," the man said, "do you speak English? I don't know Spanish. My bag is gone. Can I go get it? I need to go find it."

The officer shook his head and leaned back in his chair, looking over to a few kiosks down. He whistled and said someone's name. Another officer came over and spoke to him.

"Sir, where is your id and entry paperworks?"

"That's what I was saying, they're all in my duffle bag and I seemed to have misplaced it somewhere. Maybe on the plane. Can I go get it and return?"

"Sir, we need your identification."

"I know, I'll be right back. Sorry."

He retraced his path through the dividers, past what was by this point hundreds of people. His eyes were fixed on the ground, looking back and forth for his duffle bag. As he went his pace quicker and quickened until he was almost jogging. A young girl in a pink winter coat caught his eye and pointed at him. No sign of the back.

Once past the line of people he broke into a sprint into the corridor leading back to the gates. His heart beat loud in his chest. What would happen if he couldn't find his duffle. All his identification was in there. How could he have left it? Why didn't he pay more attention? He had fucked it all up already. It hadn't even begun and it was fucked up. As his panic increased so did he pace and by that point he was running down the corridor. On the right and left he passed people of all colors, shapes, and sizes, but could not take them in or even acknowledge their amazed looks. A loud whistle echoed from the far end of the corridor. He stopped and glanced back.

A guard with one hand on his mouth and the other on some kind of club gestured violently for him to slow down. The man nodded so the guard could see and resumed walking at a brisk pace.

Eventually he returned to the gates, saw the large numbers and the planes outside. As he passed the bathrooms he remembered going in there and stopped to look. Now there were lots of people but his bag was not there. He looked underneath the stalls and at the very end, he saw the familiar black leather strap dangling down. He went over to the stall and threw open the door.

A kid, maybe fifteen or sixteen was there, sifting through his bag. On the toilet paper rack he could see his checkbook, car keys, and earbuds. The kid was skinny, dressed like a punk, probably Chilean. Without thinking, the man grabbed him by the shirt, ripping it at the collar. He growled,

"What the fuck, man? What do you think you're doing with my stuff? That's my bag you're going through!"

The kid stammered something in Spanish and tried to break free. The man was about to let him go, but a wave of anger went through him and he shoved him hard into the toilet. The kid's back hit the side of the tank and he went down, grabbing himself with both hands. The man was immediately sorry but his anger was still high. He lunged at the kid and the kid scrambled under the stall opening and ran out.

Dizziness overcame him and he sat on the toilet and put his head in his hands. After a few minutes he collected himself and put his things back into the bag. He made sure his ID and paperwork was still there, and then took an itinerary of everything else he could remember bringing. It was all there. He took out his toiletries bag and unzipped it, popping two pills from an orange prescription bottle. He placed them on his tongue and went out to the sink. He turned on the faucet and cupped a handful of water into his mouth, swallowing the pills.

Then he returned to the stall and waited. It took half and hour or so for the Xanax to kick in, and when it did he felt the fear and dizziness subside. A heavy sense of peace and mellowness came over him. He could sleep here if he wanted, but got up and made his way back to customs. He was laughing about everything that happened and didn't even mind waiting in line for another hour. By this time it was eight in the morning and the place was brighter, his mood was brighter.

"Here, the paperwork and my ID," he handed his documents to another kiosk officer. This officer also did not speak much english. The officer nodded and wrote something down on the paper. He stamped his passport and gave it back to him, waving him through to the other side.

This place is like a maze, he thought, rounding another corner, not sure exactly where he was going, but following the general traffic of people. He smelled food somewhere, coffee, sausage, cinnamon rolls. He next entered a cavernous space, with high ceilings, baggage claim conveyers. A female voice came over the speakers in regular intervals spoke something in Spanish, in a calm voice. He found his flight number on the digital panels overhead and walked over to find his checked bag in a stack against the far wall. He wheeled it out and continued through the area, the space congested with crowds of families and businesspeople, couples and patrolling guards with guns in their holsters. He came to the back of a disorganized line, the end of which ended in a panicked crowd of travelers shoving their checked baggage through X-ray machines as officers inspected their contents on tiny monitors to the side.

A Frenchmen pushed into line ahead of him, subtly, using his cell phone conversation as a distraction. The man did not argue. He was not upset, the drugs at maximum effectiveness now. He was relaxed. He even felt proud of himself for not saying anything or reacting in outrage, although he might have only thirty minutes ago. Good stuff, he thought. Someday I have to quit.

As they approached the X-ray machines, a large German Shephard came nosing through the crowd, leading an officer by his leash. The dog sniffed at bags every now and then, sometimes stopping, but most of the time he continued without breaking a stride. When he reached the man's luggage he stopped and sniffed around for a few seconds and the man's gut dropped. Were his prescriptions legal to bring into the country? He really didn't know. Would they confiscate them, arrest him. So many fears went through his mind until the dog continued on his way. The man made eye contact with the dog's officer, who seemed preoccupied and did not return his nod.

He put his bag through the X-ray machine when it was time, and the rubber belt pulled it through the metal box. He watched it go through on the monitor and saw all his belongings in what looked like camera film negative. There was a green outline around the monitor screen, which he took as a good sign, until the officer who sat at the monitor pushed a button to stop the conveyor. A buzzer sounded and a few other officers looked around to see what was happening.

One came over and the other pointed out something to him. They both nodded and looked suspiciously at the man. Even with the sedatives in his system he was panicked and wondered what they had found. The other officer walked to the conveyor and pulled out his luggage. He unzipped it there in front of everyone, exposing his underwear, bag of q-tips, everything. He pushed everything to the side until he found an apple and a box of Cheez-Its. He pulled them out and tossed them into the trash. He then zipped up the luggage and gave the man an impatient glance, pointing to a sign which illustrated no food or produce. He gave a nod to the officer at the monitor who hit another button and the conveyor continued, this time without stopping. He was through.

He rode an escalator up to the main level into the general area of the airport. At the top he went through a crowd of expectant faces, each looking for some other face than his. The smell of food was stronger here and he had not eaten since the night before, so he decided to stop and grab something to eat before heading to the hotel. He found a coffee shop among a row of restaurants and stood in line there, pointing to a cherry danish in the glass and somehow communicating to the girl behind the counter he wanted a medium-sized mocha. He reached the counter and a man gave him the total in Spanish.

"Just take it out of this," he said, handing him the twenty from his wallet.

"No moneda Americano," the man said. He seemed agitated.

"No?"

"No," the man behind the counter repeated, and pointed down the walkway, making a gesture like exchange of money.

"Oh fuck, sorry man," the man said. He took back the twenty and pushed the coffee and danish back into the counter.

The exchange didn't open for another half hour, so the man sat on his bag against the desk. He was exhausted, hungry, and just wanted to get to the hotel so he could get some proper sleep before this afternoon. He took out his phone and checked to see if there was a signal (there wasn't) and then finished listening to a WTF with Marc Maron podcast he had started on the flight. Then he realized his battery was low so turned it off. As he sat there he remembered all his last-minute travel notes were written on the phone's notepad app. So he pulled his journal and pen from his duffle, turned back on the phone, and copied them down, just in case.

By then the exchange was opened, and he exchanged the rest of his pocket money, about a hundred and twenty dollars, for Chilean pesos. He looked at the strange, brightly colored money for a moment before stuffing it in his wallet. He returned to the coffee shop but there was a line so he said screw it and decided to head to the hotel instead.

Outside it was even colder than he remembered from this morning, overcast and windy. An old man was spraying down the walkway outside the automatic doors and some overspray him in the face. He gave the old man a nasty look and went down a ways to a line of yellow taxis, all the drivers leaned on their vehicles, waiting for customers.

"Hey man, need a lift?" one of the driver's said. He was the only one who spoke English so he gave him a nod and handed him his luggage. The driver jumped up, threw the luggage in the trunk and opened the door for the man. Once inside he asked, "Where would you like to go?" with such a strong accent and trouble articulating the words it was obvious he only knew enough English for business reasons. But it was enough.

"180 Miraflores, cross street with Moneda. Here," he handed him the notes he had jotted into his journal earlier, and pointed to the address.

"Ah, Hotel Riveria, si" The driver gave him a thumbs up, put down the fare flag, and took off.

Once far enough away, the man turned back and took in the entire airport. It was an impressive sight, the giant metal and glass structure, futuristic in that thirty year old way.

The driver weaved in and out of the traffic like a man on a mission. He made no attempt at small talk, but this was fine with him. It would have been impossible anyway. So instead, he looked out the window, a wave of relief coming over him. 

He had a moment of weakness back there, he had actually taken some Xanax. It had been a couple months since the last time. He knew it would be this way. And it was. He felt good. Thankfully he had done as his mother suggested and got the prescription filled the day he told her he was leaving. Just the Xanax and Ambien, short term stuff. No Lexapro, he didn't need a long-term solution, just a safety net. Fuck, why did he shove that poor kid? That kid probably had shit his pants. Hell, he nearly shit his. That was not him back there. Not him at all.

He saw outside the cars going by. Cars he did not recognize, smaller and older than those on the American highways. Inside were Chileans. Life here was the same as in the states. Going to work, going home. The buildings were the same, not exactly, but close enough. Old ones, shiny new ones. Dilapidated ones. Graffiti on the concrete overpass. In Spanish of course. Green signs in Spanish, roads, exits. The smells the same, gasoline, the crisp, almost metallic winter air. A gray light, overcast, maybe a little chance of rain. The people different, native, more ancient looking, shorter. He saw them walking on the sidewalks. 

Beyond the city he saw the mountains, the Andes. How far was it there, to those snowy peaks? He imagined the silence of that place in contrast to the noise down here. He was sitting there in the snow, cross-legged, he ankles exposed and freezing. The cold of the snow slowly coming through the bottom of his jeans. He shivered. The only sound here was the whipping of the wind around the crags. No life nor food. Only silence. This was no place for a human being.

He awoke still in the taxi, the driver stopped in construction traffic, frustrated and banging on the steering wheel. It was raining. Outside were people walking past, making better time than the cars. It took him a few moments to realize he was in Chile, took some time before the events of the morning came back to him. He reached into his duffle bag and pulled out his journal. Between two pages was a folded photograph. He opened it and gazed at the dark-haired woman staring back at him. She was beautiful.


Chapter Two

Curled up inside the doorway to the Hotel Riviera, a gray mutt of some kind lay oblivious to the world, preventing the old doors from opening fully. The man was soaked through by this point and had his duffle stacked on top of his luggage, which was being wheeled behind him. A stream of water fell down over the green fabric overhang of the entrance onto his bag. The man pushed hard against the door and slid the dog out of the way with it. He then twirled his luggage around and pushed them through the door first, holding the door with one hand.

Inside, the foyer was cramped with archways separating the different areas. Its decor was out of fashion by a few decades, wooden accents, paintings of ships and European beaches, dim lighting everywhere. The tiled floors were slick with rain, so the man went carefully over to the front desk. A couple was ahead of him, speaking to the hotel clerk. They argued in Spanish, and then the male customer finally threw his hands up and signed a sheet of paper. When he turned around to leave he made eye contact with the man, and rolled his eyes. The man nodded. When he approached the desk he pulled out a sheet of paper, where he had translated what he needed to tell the clerk.

"Hola, mi nombre es William S y tengo una habitaci√≥n reservada para esta noche hasta el mi√©rcoles," he read with emphasis on each word.

"Reservation you say?"

"Yes, good, you speak English. I didn't know."

The clerk nodded, "Si. Let me find your reservation."

He flipped through a small notepad on the counter.

"Mr. S?"

"Yes, that's me." the man smiled.

"We have no Mr. S with reservation. Did you mean Sloan? We have a Sloan."

"No, you should have a reservation. I wrote an email just yesterday. In Spanish. Said I was coming into the city today. Mr. S, staying through Wednesday. I received a response from a lady. I printed it out. Here."

He handed the clerk the printout. The clerk took it, read thoughtfully, and turned to a lady on the other side of the desk. They talked for some time, flipping through more papers, and finally the clerk turned back to him.

"Mr. S, we have no copy of your reservation but would be happy to rent you a room. Would you like a room?"

"Please," the man said, and then added, "at the rate you quoted in the email, $75 a night?"

The clerk frowned.

"Unfortunately, sir, we do not have any more rooms at that rate. We have a double bed room for $120 American dollars a night, is that okay?"

"Fine, that's fine."

A young boy took his luggage and walked him over to a small elevator in the back corner hallway. He put down the bags and pushed the only button. "Cinco," he said, and then wandered off. The man looked at his key, the number 512 in gold letters. Eventually a rickety platform came down and stopped. The man slid open the wooden door and wheeled his luggage into the space. He pressed the 5 button and the lift shuttered and squeaked then took him up.

The room was clean and small. It had two twin beds with a tiny shelf between them. A clock radio on the shelf blinked 12:32 am. He turned on his phone and checked the time, 11:18 am. The battery was on red so he pulled out the plug and discovered the outlets were different. "One more fucking thing," he said, turning off the phone. He set the time on the clock radio and set the alarm for 3 pm. Then he pulled back the thin sheets and blanket and curled up in them, kicking off his shoes onto the floor.

The alarm woke him at 3 and he rose and immediately opened his laptop. It still had an hour or so. He found the wifi and connected, no password required. He opened his email and reread the last email from Constanza:

	Hey! Glad you decided to come! You so crazy (in a good way ;-) 	I know you won't have phone when you get here, but maybe send 		an email from the hotel? If I don't hear from you let's just 		meet up at Juan Valdez in Providencia at 1730. Can't wait to 		meet you in person finally, so we can have one of our deep 			conversations face to face. C

	PS - I'm super nervous! xoxoxo

He replied:

	The eagle has landed! In Chile as we speak (write). I told you 	I would make it happen. This is just to let you know I'm here 		and can make it to Juan Valdez by 1730 no problem. I will see 		you there, D

	PS - I'm nervous too! @-->---

He undressed, grabbed his toiletries bag, his travel towel, and went to the bathroom. As he flipped the light switch a loud flash popped and the bathroom went dark. He fumbled around for the shower and eventually figured out a medium temperature. He got in the shower and bathed in the dim light that came in from outside. After, he pulled out his nice jeans and a dark striped button up, white t-shirt, his nice leather shoes. Fortunately there was a mirror in his toiletries bag, so he used that to floss his teeth and fix his hair.

Downstairs he approached the same clerk who checked him in and asked if he knew any stores that sold US socket adapters and also a place that sold flowers. The clerk nodded and walked around the desk. He led the man outside, where it had stopped raining. He took him by the hand and led him to the curb, traffic bumper to bumper. He pointed down to the end of Miraflores.

"See, there the intersection, look for Merced. There is a Lider. In there you can buy some flowers. For adapters, maybe head down Moneda to the market side streets. Good?"

Will nodded, but then asked, "Well, if down Moneda has a marketplace, do I need to go to the Lider? It might save me walking if I can get both in the same place."

"Do what you like, my friend. I think you will be okay," the clerk said, somewhat agitated. I need to get back to the desk."

He walked back to the hotel, but tripped over an elderly man sitting against the building. The man had only one leg, but it was extended into the walkway. He held out a styrofoam cup with a few coins in it. The clerk lost his temper and cursed at the old man, who just stared at his insults. Eventually the clerk went back into the hotel. Will felt sorry for the crippled man, and wanted to help him, but felt ashamed. He didn't know why.

Will decided to try his luck down Moneda, so took off that way, making sure he noted the direction he came from so he could find his way back. There were crowds of people, businessmen mostly, attractive women. Traffic everywhere. He passed a large church next to a large government building. He noticed certain intersections were only for pedestrian traffic, and they even had red lights and green lights. He turned down one of these side streets, Ahumeda and found a small electronics store. Luckily he had remembered to bring his plug and just showed it to the man behind the counter. The man went to the back and returned with a black adapter and that was that. Will handed him the largest Chilean bill he had and that seemed to cover it, with change back. He continued down the street, looking for a place that might sell flowers. He also glanced around for a clock but couldn't find one, so he stopped a lady going the opposite direction and tapped his wrist as if asking for the time.

"Las cuatro y media," she replied.

"English?"

"No," she shook her head and then went on.

He walked down the street, passing store after store, hundreds of people. His breathing shallower and shallower, until he had to stop and collect himself against a large movie advertisement, Cars 2. He breathed deep and slowly the dizziness passed. His heart rate returned to normal.

At last he came to another Lider, the same store the hotel clerk had mentioned, and walked in. Like most grocery stores, it had a familiar layout. But he couldn't find any section with flowers. He approached a worker stocking pizza crusts and spoke to him in English.

"Hey, can you help me find flowers? I'm in kind of a hurry."

"Que?" the man asked.

"Flowers, pretty flowers."

"Engles?"

"Si, English. Can you show me to the flowers, if you have any?"

"Si," the man said. He rose and led him over two isles to the baked goods. There the worker pointed to five and ten pound bags of flour.

"Flour" he said.

"Si," Will said, "Gracias. Gracias"

The worker smiled and walked off.

Will continued walking the isles until finally he spotted a little stand with some potted plants and flowers. He picked out bunch of red and yellow flowers in a pot, bought the entire pot and tossed it and the soil outside the store. 

He carried the flowers in one hand and the bag with the adapters in the other and decided to try to reach Providencia by Metro. He pulled out the small guide book the hotel provided and found the Metro map. The nearest station was Santa Lucia, back in the direction of Hotel Riviera. He quickened his pace and using the map, found his way back to Moneda, then up to the Santa Lucia metro entrance.

It was not too much trouble to get the metro pass, a plastic card with BIP! written in bold yellow letters. He loaded the card up with ten thousand pesos, scanned it at the gate and descended to the platform with a red sign that listed all the stops in the western direction: Universidad Catolica, Baquedano,  Salvador, Manuel Montt, Pedro De Valdivia, and Los Leones, the stop he wanted, according to the map. After a few minutes the silver train rumbled to a stop in front of him and dozens of passengers exited, while dozens more tried to get on. He squeezed on just before the doors pulled shut and a female voice came on the intercom. He stood in a pack of people, most looking at their cell phones. The train pulled away from the platform and Will watched the people outside go by in an increasing blur. Then the tunnel. Fifteen minutes later he was in Los Leones.

He followed the other passengers up the stairs around the bend to one of the exits, there were signs but he wasn't sure if it was the right one. He passed a small bakery inside and the aroma of fresh bread reminded him he hadn't eaten since he arrived earlier this morning. He went up the steps to the street and took out the street map the hotel had provided. He had marked the location of the Juan Valdez on it, and the Los Leones metro. The problem was there appeared to be two exits to the station and he couldn't easily tell which he had emerged from. He walked around the crowds to the street signs and traced them on the map, but the street he was on wasn't on the map. Finally he got frustrated and stopped a man in a suit.

"Hola, donde es Juan Valdez?" he asked, surprised he had remembered enough to articulate a complete thought in Spanish.

The man pointed behind him and said something Will did not comprehend, but that was at least something to go on.

"Si, si. Gracias!"

"De nada."

Will continued down the way the man had told him, still unsure where he was. He stopped to ask another passerby what time it was. 1645. Good. He still had plenty of time. Even so, with the crowds of people and the traffic and the stress of finding the place, he could feel the dizziness and disconnected feeling coming on. He took in a few breaths and told himself to calm down, but it didn't do much good. It was too early to take another Xanax, he had already broke his rule and taken two at the airport this morning. Better to suffer through this, but maybe he would take one before Constanza arrived, to get back in the zone.

The streets around him were shadowed by the looming office buildings and upper class department stores. Most were unfamiliar but he recognized a few, Perry Ellis, Armani. The sun was dropping below the skyline, and every so often it would appear between the cracks and briefly blind the crowd, their hands held up to their eyes in unison. He passed restaurants and cafes. The food smelled fresh and good. Maybe he would take Constanza out for a nice dinner. In the rush he hadn't even thought of what they could do. He only thought about seeing her in person. Coffee, dinner, a walk in the park. Maybe the one close to the Hotel Rivieria he had seen. A smile came over his face. It was good to be here, he thought. A bold move for sure.

A few more turns and directions from passersby later he arrived at an open square, with italian restaurant tucked in the back corner and to the right the Juan Valdez coffee shop. He went inside and asked the barista what time it was, 1700. Good. He looked in the glass display and pointed to a bright red fruit drink and also grabbed a croissant	 with butter. He found a comfortable spot upstairs with a good view of the entrance so he wouldn't miss Constanza arriving. He popped a Xanax and drank it down the fruit drink. The drink was way too sweet, like syrup. He winced and walked down to the bar and asked for agua. They gave him a premium bottled water and he couldn't figure out how to ask for tap water, so he paid for it and returned upstairs.

Juan Valdez was nice enough, a chain obviously, comparable to Starbucks in the States, although he had seen a few of those along the way too. Will wasn't much of a coffee drinker but the croissant was good, warm, freshly made. The patrons seemed like college students, upper class businessmen and women meeting after work. A girl close to him was typing into a Macbook and listening to something poppy in her headphones, he could almost hear the tune.

Fifteen minutes later he could feel the Xanax take effect, something like sinking into a warm mud bath. He closed his eyes and listened to the Spanish rock music they had playing over the speakers. Today it was okay to take the Xanax, but today only. Last minute travel to foreign country to see a woman he had never met certainly qualified as a stressor, if anything did. He  scanned the downstairs one time to make sure she had not yet arrived. They should have arranged a signal of some kind, like a flower on her shirt or something. Knowing someone from a photo is quite a different thing from recognizing them in person. He had been on enough online dates to know that. But he was sure it wouldn't be too hard to spot Constanza. Her picture was honest. Good lighting, a square angle. She had nothing to hide from the camera that's for sure.

He asked the girl next to him what time it was, 1745. He walked downstairs and scanned the floor, but did not see her. Just then a girl walked through the entrance he thought was her, but it wasn't. He must have been staring too intently at the customers as they all seemed to stop what they were doing and stare back at him. He pretended he was checking his phone (although it was turned off) and walked outside to look around. By now the streets were bathed in twilight, the lights from the storefronts still open giving off a glow. There were only a few tables outside and she was not here either. He went back inside, upstairs and waited.

Half an hour later, Will was wondering if he should try to find a computer, or head back to the hotel to check his email there. It was dark outside. He walked down to the barista and asked the time, 1840. Even with the sedative in his system he was anxious. He didn't want to blow this meetup. It was almost perfect, if she'd just get here already. He pulled the photograph from his pocket and showed it to the barista, then gestured to the cafe. The barista leaned in to get a good look at the photo and then looked up at Will, smiling. Will again swept the room with a gesture as if asking if he had seen her there. The barista slowly grinned and shook his head. He said something, a name, that Will did not recognize.

"Constanza," he said, pointing to the photograph.

The barista laughed, "Ana Tijoux, si!" He whistled at his coworkers down the line - they walked over. He asked Will for the photo, showed them, then started acting like he was singing into a microphone. One of the girls looked up at Will and giggled. "Ana Tijoux," they repeated to each other and laughed.

"Who's Ana Tijoux, are you saying that's the girl in the picture? What are you saying?"

The baristas looked at him and then a younger guy ran in back and brought back a tablet, punched in a few keys and handed it to Will. There, unmistakable, was Constanza, rapping in a YouTube video. It had a few million views. "Ana Tijoux, love her" read the top comment. Will typed Ana Tijoux in the search box and switched to the images tab. There he saw dozens of photos of Ana Tijoux, Chilean pop artist with French ancestry. Lots of the photos were slick and glossy with obvious retouches, but there were a few candid ones, her looking like a normal girl, and towards the bottom of the screen he saw his own photo of Ana, Constanza. His heart sank.

Will handed back the tablet to the barista and walked out into the street. The crowds had thinned and the square was silent for the moment, a distant honking. He walked in the direction he thought his hotel was in but did not consult the map. Before he realized it he was looking at the Pedro De Valdivia metro entrance but passed it by. He felt like he needed to breath in the cool evening air and couldn't conceive of going down where he had no air to breathe. He passed more restaurants but was no longer hungry. A sick, hollow feeling in his stomach replaced the hunger. A few dogs in a pack hurried past as if they were headed somewhere important, then turned a corner onto a side street. Will followed them just to have something outside his own thoughts to focus on. The lead dog was larger than the rest and wore a tattered vest of some kind. It looked warm.

The dogs came to a restaurant called the Hotel California, where the smell of grilled meat and the sound of clinking mugs of beer and loud music swirled through the street outside. The dogs ducked into a small space between the restaurant and disappeared. Will stopped at the entrance and looked inside. There was a game on the big screen TV and people laughing and smoking at the bar. Upstairs he saw a couple cuddling against the window. He went inside.


Chapter Three

Will ordered a burger and cerveza from the menu and then stared at the bar top in contemplation. All around him the patrons were having a good time. When the beer came, he drank it down quick, with a Xanax, and then just waited for the numbness to take hold. By the time the burger came he was barely conscious of wolfing it down. It surprised him to see the clean plate in front of him. He let out a deep belch and and held the empty mug up to the bartender. The bartender nodded and filled his mug. He thought about ordering another burger, just for the hell of it, but decided to drink the calories instead.

By the middle of the second round he had begun watching the game with the other patrons. It was a soccer game, between who he couldn't say, but one of them had to be Chile based on the reactions. Each time one team made a goal the entire place shouted in unison. Their energy was infectious. Before long Will was shouting along with them. He even gave out a few high fives as the heaviness of the sedative took effect and made everything better. He grinned at nothing and thought about nothing except what was in front of him. A bowl of nuts. He ate a couple.

At some point he felt the presence of someone over his shoulder. It was a man, leaning far over the bar, waving to the bartender.

"No, no man, he won't respond to that shit," Will said, "You gotta do it like this."

Will took the last swig from the mug and slammed it down to the inside edge of the bar. The bartender looked up, made eye contact with Will, who waved him over. When the bartender came over, he gestured to the man, who smiled.

"Quattro tequila shots, se√±or. Got Patr√µn?"

"Si, quattro Patr√µn?"

"Yes indeed, se√±or bartender."

Will looked up at the man for the first time. He was tall, shoulder-length brown hair, clearly from the States.

"Wait," Will stammered, "Are you American?"

"Ben," the man held out his hand, "we have a party going on in the back, bunch of expats, if you care to join?"

Will shook his hand, and when the shots came up Ben asked for one more and then he and Will walked back through the restaurant. As he arose the room spun a little and Will held onto the bar to steady himself. Each room they went through was painted a different bright color, yellow, blue, then red. Ben rounded the corner next to the bathrooms and they entered an open space with plants, bench seats and a dart board on the end.

Ben walked over to a small group next to the dartboard. They all looked up hazily, as if they had been well drunk for some time.

"Fulbrights. Will," Ben introduced, setting the tray of drinks down on a small table between them, "Will. the Fulbrights of Chile in all their majesty."

"Are you guys related then?"

"In what sense?" a nerdy fellow at the dartboard asked. He pulled all the darts from the board and walked back to the taped line a few feet away.

Ben said, "Have you never heard of the Fulbright Scholarship Program?"

Ben distributed the shots among the group, who seemed to come alive at the prospect of another round of shots. He handed Will a shot last. They nodded to one another and downed the drinks. Will's head spun as he slung his head back. He followed the tequila with a slice of lemon and smacked his lips. Everyone gave an approving shout.

"Oh, I think I have heard of it. Wasn't Bill Clinton a Fulbright Scholar? What do you do?"

An attractive girl with long hair approached him and held out her hand.

"Nice to meet you. I'm Janette," she said, "Fulbright is an international exchange program for students, you apply for it with an idea of somewhere you'd like to visit to do research, and if they like your idea they give you money to go do it, basically. It's not that big of a deal."

"No," Ben laughed, "It's totally a big deal. We're really fucking smart and you probably couldn't get in if you tried."

"Whatever," Janette punched him in the arm.

"So you met me, and that is Jamie over there with the glasses, and that's Robert in the corner, but we call him the Silent One."

Will waved to Jamie, who saluted and threw another dart. He looked over to the corner and saw a young guy in a dark coat leaning back in a lounge chair with his eyes shut.

"The silent one?" Will asked, "Does he not talk?"

Jamie walked over and held out his hand. "He doesn't talk actually. He has taken a vow of silence for a year, in person, online, everywhere. None of these guys actually knows what he sounds like. I do though."

"I bet he sounds like Barry White," Janette laughed and sat down again.

"I'll never tell," Jamie said.

"Interesting."

"It's not as pretentious as it sounds," Jamie said, "I mean, it's pretentious, but its not utter bullshit. Robert is more of an artist than the rest of us. The rest of us are scientists."

"So the vow is an art project?"

"Kind of. The vow is certainly part of it, but the most interesting part is the social media aspect. Are you at all interested in this? Cause I can stop."

"No," Will said, "I'm interested."

"Well," Jamie began, as if he was used to explaining it, "So first of all, you have to understand the conception of it all. The thesis I suppose. And the thesis is this: The number one of plague of our time is the proliferation of mass communication. This is a new phenomena in history, up to now lack of information has always been the problem. Now our problem is so much information that it becomes chaos, noise, distraction. And so, since the responsibility of the artist in a society is to intuit its problems and manifest the appropriate response, Robert has consciously created a new artistic movement."

Jamie paused for effect. 

Ben grinned, "Wait for it."

"It's called Shutthefuckupism," Jamie said, "The art of complete and utter silence. This is where the vow of silence comes in, but the coolest part is that it's not just in person. He's on all the social media sites, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, SnapChat. He posts silence and responds to other social media utterances with silence. It's kind of amazing. He has thousands of followers. You should follow him."

At that point Robert raised his arm and gave a thumbs up and then went back to doing whatever he was doing.

"So," Ben said, "who's up for a game of darts?"

"I am," Janette said.

"I, sir," Jamie said.

"Sure," Will said.

"But you know," Jamie lifted a finger. "It would be extra special if we had another round of shots. Who's with me?"

They all were and each gave Jamie some cash for another round. Will pitched in a few thousand pesos. Jamie went off towards the bar and the rest lined up behind the dart board line. They took turns tossing darts, none sticking, no one keeping count. When all the darts were on the floor, then someone would pick them up, carry them back, and they would start again. There was a lull in the conversation but as everyone was heavily sedated by that point it was not uncomfortable.

"Janette," Will asked, "so what are you doing with your time in Chile?"

She immediately responded as if from memory, "I'm implementing a shortwave radio distribution program among indigenous farming communities of southern Chile."

"What?"

"In the forests are communities of farmers going generations back, but currently they have no technology to communicate between themselves, and if they did, it could greatly improve their social well-being in a multitude of ways, primarily preservation of their culture. So myself along with a few others plan to introduce low-technology based communication to the people there as a way to help them see the benefits of inter-community relationships."

"That's pretty cool," Will said, "do they have problems now?"

"Of course," Janette responded, somewhat defensive, "sharing in real-time information regarding the weather, illnesses, tips about crops, not to mention a wider sense of connectedness, not seeing others as a threat but as an extension of your own community. We've already seen good results in a few prototype villages."

"What is the end goal of a program like this?"

"What do you mean?"

"You are introducing new technology to a community, low-grade technology now, and you are seeing good results. Does that mean it will lead to introducing more modern technology later? The Internet, for example?"

"You don't understand, Will. Some of these people haven't even seen a computer. They might understand what it is, but they are a long time from using Twitter."

"I get that, but as you were talking I had a vision of these villages communicating and it seems like eventually they would all merge into one village. I don't see that stopping with shortwave radio. Why would it? Technology doesn't stop. It's like evolution. It keeps developing and adapting. So maybe now they're not on Twitter, but eventually, why not?"

"Then they would be connected to the whole world."

"Well," Janette argued, "that isn't the goal. That would be sad."

"Why sad?"

"Because then there would be a direct line for outside cultural influences to invade the communities. They would lose their individuation."

"You mean kids in the villages listening to Lady Gaga?"

"Superficially, yes. But the whole purpose is to help preserve these ancient traditions. They are slowly dying out. It is a way to help them unite and strengthen those bonds."

"Maybe it is inevitable."

"I hope not," Janette said, "that would be sad."

"You keep using that word," Jamie said, "but that word has no place in evolution, which is what we're talking about really. Technology is part of our evolution as much as an opposable thumb. So, okay, taking this idea in a different direction, are we - I mean modern people - losing our own sense of cultural individuation, from our technology? These days the communication from here to China is a matter of seconds."

"I think we're most definitely seeing a blurring of the lines between cultures," Will agreed.

"But, is that so bad a thing? Why are we any different from those primitive villages? Should our traditions be preserved?"

"I think so," Janette said.

"Now you sound like a segregationist."

"What are you talking about?"

"This conversation is getting way too philosophical, that can't go anywhere good." Ben interjected.

"I don't think so," Jamie said, "it's interesting. We seem to have this idea that certain traditions should be preserved and shielded from the evils of mass communication, but at the same time there is this idea that mass communication is enabling us to increase community. So, which is it? Is the ideal be one global village or many separate villages? You can't have both."

"I'm lost," Will said, his head reeling from the combination of Xanax and alcohol.

"I'm not a political scientist," Janette said, "We can help those people, and so we are."

"Well, I am a political scientist and I think the global village is inevitable, whether we want it or not, and those traditions of thousands of years will eventually be lost forever. It's happened before, and its happening now, and it will happen. There is a tendency in the universe towards unity."

"Entropy," Ben corrected.

"That's just a semantics. Utter entropy eventually begets homageneity, aka unity."

"Wrong, although that's pretty clever," Ben observed, "Utter entropy would be an infinite number of atoms, all separate, all self-contained, neither depending on or communicating with any other. So, eternal loneliness."

"This conversation is making me sad," Janette said, "let's change the subject. Will, what's your story? Why are you in Chile? Are you a student?"

"Wait," Ben said, "I think its Will's turn to get drinks."

"Will's turn!" Jamie and Janette shouted in unison.

"Okay," Will said, "I'll get the next round. What are we having. More shots?"

"I want a drink drink," Janette said.

"Piscola?"

"Alright, yeah," Janette said.

"Five piscolas, se√±or Will," Ben said, "that is, if you want one."

"What the heck is a piscola?"

"You'll like it. It's traditional. Try one."

"Okay," Will said.

Will walked back through the dining room on his way back to the bar, but stopped first at the bathrooms, which were painted sky blue with white clouds. He took a piss, then instinctively leaned over and threw up into the toilet. Everything from the day came up. He saw stars and lost his balance momentarily, catching himself on the sink. He wasn't nauseous. Briefly, the old pounding heartbeat back came back and the old dizziness, but then it subsided. He thought about Constanza, about the person she really was. He wondered if he should say anything about it to the Fulbrights. They seemed understanding enough. 

He collected himself and went to the bar. He expected to have trouble with the order but the bartender understood piscola just fine. The crowd next to him had a tray of pita chips and some kind of creamy salsa, so Will pointed that out to the bartender as well and he acknowledged.

When he returned the Fulbrights were back at a game of darts. The Silent One was standing at a door smoking. Will set the tray of drinks down on the table and a waitress followed him with the pita chips and salsa.

"Oh, snacks, awesome!" Jamie said.

Ben and Jamie came over and dipped out some chips. Will offered some to Robert, who walked over and helped himself. He then asked Janette, who was only drinking.

"I don't eat gluten, sorry."

"No problem," Will said, "are you allergic?"

"Not allergic per se, but anytime I eat processed bread I get a lot of congestion for a day or so."

"Bullshit," Jamie said.

"No, its not bullshit, Jamie, how are you an expert on how my body reacts to food?"

"Have you always had this reaction? Even when your mom fed you peanut butter and jelly sandwiches when you were a kid?"

"How should I know?" Janette said. She threw another dart at the board and it stuck to her surprise.

"I'll tell you when it started, it happened when you first heard from some hippie ass nutritionist on youtube that consuming gluten was toxic and saw all these testimonials from whack jobs about the evils of processed food."

"So you think processed food is good for you?"

"I think we should eat as close to nature as possible, but I also don't think eating white bread causes congestion. What about the billions of people who eat white bread everyday and are just fine. I just can't listen to crap like that."

"Why are you being so angry all of a sudden?"

"It's just a pet peeve of mine. All these kind of people are just privileged snobs if you ask me. You'd never see a starving child refusing a slice of white bread because it wasn't as pure as unprocessed food."

"Fuck you," Janette said.

"And what do you think is in that piscola you're drinking? They might use real cane sugar in the cola down here, but its still refined as all get out."

"Whatever man, I'm trying to have a good time tonight, and you're killing my buzz."

Ben walked over to Jamie and whispered into his ear. Jamie nodded and walked to the back of the room where the Silent One had found a new spot.

Will took a drink of the piscola and tried to think of something to break the tension.

"So, you guys want to hear why I'm here?" Will said, "I promise its a good story. It's fucked up to tell you the truth."

"Yes, please Will, let's talk about something fun for a change," Janette said. She grabbed Will by the arm, "Tell us!"

"I am here about a girl."

"That old chestnut?" Ben winked.

"Aww," Janette said, "so you came down here to meet your true love? How did you meet her?"

They each clinked their piscolas in a toast.

Jamie came back over, his curiosity piqued.

"Wait, what did I hear?" Jamie asked, "I feel like I missed something. Are you and Ben getting married?"

"No," Ben blushed, "Will came to Chile for a girl. We haven't heard the whole story yet."

"It's kind of embarrassing to be honest. I met her online and we talked for a month or so, like everyday, and somehow it came up that I should come see her, and the other day I said fuck it, and bought a ticket."

"Fucking killer man. Kudos," Jamie said.

"So where is she?" Ben asked.

"Well, I just flew in this morning, and we were supposed to meet up at the Juan Valdez down the street. But, she didn't show at the time we agreed, and then there was this picture."

Will pulled the photograph from his back pocket, now wadded up, and showed it to them.

"Cute," Ben said.

"She's really pretty," Janette said.

"I know, but the only thing is its not her. Its some Chilean pop singer, named Ana Tijoux. The baristas showed me there at the coffee shop."

"Oh my god!" Janette gasped.

"Dude," Jamie said, "that is the catfish of all catfishes! Holy shit!"

"What is a catfish?" Janette asked.

"Oh, Janette," Jamie shook his head in mock disappointment. "Have you not been keeping up with your memes. One does not simply not keep up with internet memes."

"Ain't nobody got time for dat!" Ben shouted. Everyone laughed.

"A catfish is when you get to know somebody through Facebook, OkCupid, whatever and they turn out not to be who they say they are. It's from a documentary. I don't know why."

"So what happened then?" Ben asked, genuinely concerned.

"Nothing. I mean, it just happened maybe thirty minutes ago. I came directly over here from there."

"You need to call her right now!" Janette shouted, "I wonder who she is."

"I can't call her because I don't have her number. Just email."

"Well, email her then. Say, who the fuck are you, bitch?" Janette was upset.

Jamie pulled out his phone and opened the browser. "You say you can email her, here use my phone, send her an email. This is like a mystery. You just have to see her, find out who she really is."

Will took the phone and signed in to his Gmail. He found the last email from Constanza and responded with a simple message.

	Who are you really? I would like to meet you. D

He hit send, handed the phone back to Jamie, and told the others what he sent.

"That's good man," Jamie agreed, "Direct and to the point."

They played another few rounds of darts and had another round of shots. Jamie apologized to Janette and they hugged it out. Everyone was drunk by this point, Will had to slow down after the last round of shots, because combined with the Xanax, he found he could barely keep his eyes opened. 

They all sat around on the couches, the darts spread haphazard on the floor in front of them. The Silent One was asleep. Ben and Janette sat close together, but not touching. Jamie was looking at his phone. Nobody was talking. There was lively music filtering in from somewhere outside, a live band.

"Well," Ben said, rising slowly, "whose up for a walk to Plaza Italia!"

"Taxi maybe," Jamie looked up from his phone.

"I'm not going anywhere near that place," Janette argued, "Not tonight. The Carabineros will be all over with those protesters out. The metros shut down at eight, I heard somebody talking about it earlier."

"But the gigantic screen, the game! I can't miss it before I go back to the Atacama. Jamie, you in? We can taxi it, I don't care. I just want to go, man. Come on!"

Jamie put down his phone.

"Wait a minute, what is Janette talking about Carabineros? Why will they be out there?" 

"Because," Janette explained, "those protesters are going to be out in the Plaza tonight."

"The Dogs?" Jamie asked, concerned, "Those guys?"

"Uh, si se√±or, los Perros de Santiago. The same ones who smashed all those windows down Moneda last month and set fires in the streets."

"Okay, I'm not going then. Don't feel like dying tonight, thanks."

"Wait," Ben argued, "there's gonna be hundreds of people out there watching the game on the gigantic screen. If they are okay with it, what's the big deal?"

"They're not gringos." Janette argued. Ben thought that was a good point.

Will had been listening and finally his curiosity got the better of him, "What are you guys talking about? I am totally lost."

"Oh, sorry Will," Jamie explained, "You just picked the absolute worse time to come to Santiago since Pinochet."

Janette picked up, "There's this group, Los Perros de Santiago, the Dogs of Santiago, they started as a student political organization a year or so ago, holding organized protests around the inequalities of the Chilean school system, where those with connections get all the opportunities, while those without the connections are left out in the cold. It made international news."

Ben sat back down, explaining further, "It was a good thing actually. Got people talking, thinking. They would not relent in their message. They shut down the schools, barricaded them with makeshift walls of desks."

"All so people without a voice could get an education?" Will asked.

"Yeah, basically," Janette said, "It was an idealistic crusade at its core. And it could have been successful, people in the government were starting to listen, starting to agree with them.  Talks were happening. But then it spiraled out of control."

"What happened?"

"The message got bigger. See, it started with a very specific goal in mind, and all the anger and outrage was directed at righting this particular wrong, the inequality of the school system. But, the leader of the Dogs started injecting all this anti-capitalist propaganda into the protests."

"And the students ate it up," Ben said.

"Well, yeah," Jamie said, "because a lot of it is true. It's all connected. As they started looking into the heart of the issues, they could see it all stemmed from a conscious effort by the wealthy minority of the country to foster a more American capitalist social structure into being. Chile is not a wealthy country, relatively speaking. They have the copper mines and a few other agriculture exports, but they have always been a somewhat second-world country. And of course, the folks on the hill want to change that. They see it as a kind of patriotism actually."

"So what happened?" Will asked, "What does all that have to do with a soccer game on a gigantic screen in Plaza Whatever?"

"Plaza Italia," Ben corrected, "Well, like we were saying, it started with protests. You can't really imagine these protests, they were officially sanctioned and scheduled. The government said, you can protest here and here, from this time to this time. So the students would comply. They would say, okay, everybody show up at Park Bustamante at 1800 on Friday and we will protest. So everybody would show up, and they would get angry and speechify and shout, and the carabineros would be there, on standby at the fringes, and then it would be over and everyone would go out and party."

"Fucking weird man," Jamie said, "I remember the first time I saw it. I just got here, before the Fulbright program, staying at hostels. One day I was walking down Moneda, most of these protests happen in the business district for obvious reasons, and there was this tension in the air. The streets were empty. You could cut the tension with a knife, pardon the cliche but that's what it was like, man, almost a tangible thing. And I didn't know what the fuck was going on, just walking down the street like an asshole, with my head up my ass."

"Sort of like always," Janette laughed.

"Whatever, bitch," Jamie winked, "so I came to this area, this wide open area, the square with the capital building, all this manicured landscaping and statues, marble. And there were about a hundred college students, shouting and raising their hands. They had signs. There were carabineros on horseback, carabineros wearing riot gear, with the shields and everything. And it seemed like a single wrong look could set the whole thing off like a stick of dynamite."

"It really is like that," Ben agreed.

"The one detail I always remember is that as I stood in this potentially violent situation with dozens of angry people, I turn around to walk back and on the other side of the street is this frail old lady, carrying groceries, as if was just another day. She didn't seem to notice. It calmed me somehow."

"You haven't answered my question yet," Will observed, "Why the big deal tonight?"

"Well," Janette picked up, "as the protests became more anti-capitalist and philosophical in nature, they naturally became more angry because there was no way to directly answer the issue, not in a tangible way. So things escalated. Then one day, back in the summer, the Dogs held a protest outside the sanctioned place and time. This really made people uneasy. For the first time they called out tanks and armored trucks. The government brought out the pepper spray, water canons, billy sticks. Then it happened. Some kid threw a brick into a crowd of carabineros and hit one of them in the head. There was an all-out brawl and needless to say the police beat the kids down. They were unprepared for anything like that. This did not make international news, for obvious reasons. The powers that be wanted to keep it secret. So, that's how it happened. After that there were no talks. Protests happened on short notice, promoted on Twitter and other social media. The government scrambles each time and violence is the norm rather than a feeling in the air. The kids regularly set fires in the streets. Destroy property. And the carabineros blast them with water cannons, pepper spray, and beat them senseless with billy sticks."

"So," Ben said, "now you know. There is a game in Plaza Italia tonight and word on the streets is, the Dogs are gonna be out there too, to get some visibility for their message."

"There's one thing you left out," Jamie added.

"What's that?" Ben asked.

"They hate Americans."

"Oh yeah," Ben said to Will, "They hate our guts, being the spoiled offspring of the capitalist system."

Will sat in silence and processed what they had just told him.

"So," Ben said at last, "you up for it?"

"Why are they called The Dogs of Santiago?" Will asked.

"You just got here," Janette observed, "but haven't you seen the stray dogs all over the place? They're everywhere in the city. People just tolerate them here. They ignore them for the most part, but some feed them and make sure they have some warmth during the winter. You may have seen some with these vests on. They are named after those stray animals of the city, a metaphor. For what exactly I'm not sure."

"It sounds cool, basically," Jamie added.

They all laughed. Finally Will said, "Fuck it, I'm in. I could use some exercise."

Ben jumped up and slapped Will on the back.

"Let's do it, man. We don't have anything to worry about, trust me. It's gonna be an awesome game. Wait till you see this screen. It's fucking huge."

"Gigantic even," Jamie added.

Jamie walked over and woke up The Silent One. Ben grabbed their coats and handed them out. Will stood up and realized he was much too drunk to make any intelligent decision about whether to go into a potential violent situation. They headed out the back door, through the empty courtyard and stood on the street, where a few cabs were waiting. Janette waved to one of them and it immediately zipped up to the curb, smoke curling out of its tailpipe.

"It is fucking cold out here," Jamie observed. He threw on his peacoat and opened the cab door. Janette climbed in, then Jamie, then the Silent One. When the door was shut she rolled down the window.

"Hey, you guys be careful. Stay in the crowds. Will, it was nice to meet you. I hope you meet up with that girl."

"Nice to meet you too, thanks."

The cab pulled off and turned the corner. Ben lit a cigarette and offered one to Will. He refused.

"What is it you do here?" Will asked, "I don't think that ever came up."

"I'm an astronomer," Ben answered.

"You don't seem like an astronomer."

Ben laughed.

"What do I seem like then?"

"Cab driver," Will offered.

"Nice," Ben said, "I could do that I suppose. Feel like hoofin it for awhile?"

"Let's do it," Will said.

The both of them rounded the corner and headed down Pedro De Valdivia towards Plaza Italia.


Chapter Four

It was a cold night, clear. Gazing up the stars were visible even with the street lights. Will and Ben walked a brisk pace towards Plaza Italia. Traffic was light, a cab every now and then. They passed the Los Leones metro entrance and saw the gates were pulled down, even though it was still early. A homeless man asked Ben for a light at a bus stop. They stopped and then resumed almost without missing a beat.

Will looked down an alley and had something like deja vu. It made him shiver. This time yesterday he was driving to the airport. And now he was here. At this time yesterday he thought he would be walking down the street with a pretty Chilean girl named Constanza, but instead he was walking with an American astronomer named Ben.

"So what does an astronomer do in Chile?" Will asked.

"Heard of the Atacama observatory?"

I've never heard of Atacama."

Ben laughed.

"It's the driest place on Earth, a desert north of here. There is an observatory. We do our work there."

"What is your work?"

"Right now, looking for proof of dark energy."

"I've heard of that."

"Yeah, it is one of the more important theories in the field."

"I've always loved astronomy. Thinking about space. The infinite."

"Same here."

"Is space infinite?" Will asked.

"Depends on what model of the universe you accept," Ben replied, "Although nobody really knows. Anybody who says they do is full of shit or trying to get your money. Or both."

They crossed a large intersection with traffic and plenty of open restaurants. Will smelled the food and wanted to stop for something else to eat. He saw a McDonald's in the distance and wondered what a Big Mac here tasted like. Did they even have them?

Ben stopped once they crossed the intersection.

"Listen, you want to grab a cab the rest of the way. It's a good  twenty minute walk from here."

"I'm okay with walking," Will said, "I like seeing the city at night."

"Cool," Ben said. They continued walking.

"So, that sucks about your girl, man," Ben said, "are you bummed?"

Will thought for a moment.

"To be perfectly honest I got hammered before I got a chance to get bummed, so you'll have to ask me in the morning."

Ben chuckled.

"I hear you."

"What about you and Janette? I noticed a little something there."

"Who knows, man?" Ben said, "That's been a long and winding road."

"She's cute."

"Yeah."

Ben walked at such a fast pace Will had trouble keeping up. He never stopped at the intersections if there was no car coming, even if was a no walking sign.

"Are we headed in the general direction of Moneda?" Will asked.

"Yeah, Moneda is past Plaza Italia. That where you're staying?"

"Yeah," Will said, then returning to the previous subject, "Anyway, you probably don't have much to worry about. I bet you astronomers get all the ladies."

"You'd think so, but unfortunately that's not the case. We're pretty fucking nerdy to be quite honest."

They came to an area where the streetlights were either out or non-existent. It was dark, but Ben navigated confidently through a few strange turns. Will caught his reflection on the glass of a small shop and saw his breath fog.

At that moment a loud noise sounded in the alley behind them. It sounded like someone banging on a tin can with a baseball bat. They saw two teenagers in hoodies emerge from the alleyway walking in the same direction as them. Ben gave Will a nervous glance and then suddenly picked up his pace. Will picked up his pace as well and gave a quick glance back to see if the two teenagers were still there. They were.

"Keep walking," Ben whispered, "If I say run, start fucking running."

A cab came by with its lights off and Ben walked to the curb and tried to flag it down, still keeping his pace. The cab drove by in silence and continued past them.

One of the teenagers shouted, "Hola, gringo!"

Ben looked at Will and kept walking at a rapid pace. It was clear the two teenagers were gaining ground. Will looked in futility at all the closed businesses around them. If only it could be a few hours earlier, these businesses would not be closed and they could go inside, out of the dark, where it was safe. But it was now. It was always fucking now.

A baseball bat slid into Will's heel and tripped him up momentarily, but caught himself. Ben shouted, "Run!" but Will had already sprinted ahead by a few feet. Everything slowed down and out of the corner of his eye Will saw a hand reach over Ben's and grab hold. He was jerked around hard and pushed to the ground. Will kept running. The teens were shouting in Spanish in Will's direction. He stopped. One of the teens kicked Ben in the stomach and held a box cutter up to his cheek. Ben nervously pulled his wallet out of his pocket and threw it at the teens. Will stood his ground, afraid to come closer.

The other teen looked up and they exchanged glances. There was a meanness in his eyes that seemed unnatural in a face so young.

Two headlights came down the street shining brightly on the scene. The teenagers took that as a cue to bolt, so they left Ben there on the ground and disappeared into an alleyway. The car passed without stopping.

Will ran over to Ben who had gotten up and was dusting himself off. Ben was shaking all over and jumped when Will put his hand on his shoulder. He smelled piss.

"Hey, it's just me," Will said, "they ran off. Let's get out of here."

"Yeah," Ben said, dazed.

They took off down the road until they were back in a more well-lighted strip of the road. Then they stopped.

"Fuck," Ben said, "Fuck. Can't believe those fuckers mugged me. That's the last thing I needed, man. Shit."

"I'm sorry man," Will said.

"Did they get you?"

"No, the headlights scared them off before they got to me. Fuck man, I should have listened to you when you said we should get a cab."

"No, fuck that man. You didn't know we'd get mugged."

Ben took a deep breath. He started looking at the road. There was more traffic.

"Look, man. That really freaked me out. I don't think I can handle a crowd after going through that. I'm just gonna head back to the hotel and call it a night. My fucking ID was in my wallet."

"No problem, Ben. I understand," Will said.

"Can you spot me ten thousand pesos, or so, so I can get back to the hotel? Gonna stay right here til a cab comes."

Will reached in his wallet and pulled out the money.

"I'll stay with you," Will said, "Think we should call the cops?"

"No," Ben looked up, surprised, "No way man, too much headache. They're not gonna find those kids."

"I'll stay," Will said, "fuck the game."

"No, go on man. I'm not feeling much like company now anyway. It was nice to meet you, Will. Maybe we'll meet up some other time."

They exchanged email addresses, then Ben stood up and held out his thumb for a cab. Will stood there.

"You sure you're okay?" Will asked, unsure whether he should go.

"I'm good man," Ben said, "I'll be fine."

"Alright, take it easy," Will said, and then turned down the street. Ben did not respond, but Will turned back a few minutes later and saw Ben getting in the back of a cab. 

He was alone again. He continued down the street, in the direction Ben had said Plaza Italia was. The events of the mugging replayed over and over in his head. Had he acted cowardly? Was that why Ben had acted so upset towards him just now? It was the first time he had been in a situation like that. It was true what they said, how time slowed down. Each moment was clear in his mind. A more courageous person might have run back immediately to help his friend. Was he a friend?

There were more cars appearing now, more people on the sidewalk. He passed another metro stop with a gated entrance. His heart had still not calmed down. He did not make eye contact with anyone he met. When they had left the California Cantina the empty streets gave off a peaceful, serene feeling but now they felt sinister. Every locked door, every homeless man in a doorway felt like a violation, like a some kind of evil invading the world. 

Will felt he was was not in a good state of mind to be entering a crowded space. Maybe he should get a cab too, return to the Hotel Riveria and sleep it off. Maybe decide what to do about Constanza. Had he already sent her an email? He wasn't sure if he had. Who was she? Why had she catfished him? The person who had those late-night conversations with him, who was that? He was so happy to have found her. When they talked they even completed each other's thoughts. Not in that cheesy way, but in a real way, a spiritual way. She understood him, thousands of miles away, she knew who he was in a way even his mother did not. But was all that a dream? Did it even happen the way he remembered?

As he came around a turn in the road, immediately he saw lights in the distance, brightening the face of buildings down at the end of the road. He saw people, cars. He heard the roar of a crowd, music. He kept walking. As he got closer he could make out more and more specific sounds, there was a band playing in the small courtyard of a place in the park. Will started to make out the large screen. He saw the larger than life players on the screen. Then, when he got very close, and the plaza opened up, he saw a large group of protesters off the side, standing in an open concrete courtyard. There was a metro entrance there, Baquedano, also gated. The protesters were nearly all young, angry, some had that same meanness in their eyes. They wore military jackets and earrings, carried some signs with slogans Will could not understand. But he recognized the symbols they bore: a fist raised in anger, a gas mask inside out, a dollar sign made out of flowers, a baby with a skeleton head, the Chilean flag burning.
