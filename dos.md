THE DOGS OF SANTIAGO
by Daniel Stepp

Chapter One

As he stepped off the plane onto the walkway between the exit door and the terminal gate, he felt a bitterly cold July wind whip in through one of the slits in the fabric joins. He weaved through the passengers, stumbling and bleary-eyed, and found his way to the nearest restroom, where he found some jeans he had brought just in case, and an old flannel shirt he kept tucked in a side pouch of his duffle. 

A fat man, Chilean, emerged from the last stall. He looked surprised to see a half-naked American there, but made no eye contact and walked straight out without a nod. The man pulled up his jeans and washed his face in the dirty sink. He caught himself in the mirror. The dim neon lights shadowed his face with older and more tired lines. He never could sleep on a plane, or a bus, or any other place for that matter. Not without pills anyway. And he wanted to conserve them for when it got bad again.

"Muchas gracias, se√±or," he greeted his reflection.

"De nada," his reflection answered back.

It was a cavernous hallway, from the gates to customs, with brick-lined walls. It looked old here, a futuristic design from thirty years ago. Everything was dim, in half light. Above were skylights, but outside it was still early morning, the night sky lightening against the dark clouds. The floors shined. You could see fifty yards ahead. Down there, close to a row of doors was a janitor, slowly mopping. The man kept pace with the others, most sleepwalking without really knowing where they were headed. There were signs in Spanish, and arrows. He had downloaded a translator app before leaving, but did not feel the need to pull it out just now. There seemed only one way to go.

Remembering what he had read about long flights he moved his legs and ankles more than necessary as he walked, kicking up his heels ever so often. Get the blood flowing. He had not had much of a chance on the plane stretch his legs or get up and walk around, since he was on a window seat and there were others blocking him. He had a real fear of pulmonary embolism. You could be fine for a day, after a fourteen hour flight. Then suddenly you collapse as the clot that formed the day before as blood gathered in your ankles reaches your lungs. Maybe you are having dinner with business partners. Maybe you are dancing with a pretty girl you met that day. And now you were dead. It gave him chills, and he knew he could not fully let it go until maybe tomorrow, or the day after. He would keep thinking about it and wondering in the back of his mind, will I die now? He braced himself against the corridor wall and gave both legs a good stretch. Then kept walking.

Finally his group reached a vast room. It came suddenly, around a bend, and everyone woke up a little more. There were more signs and arrows, but they were not necessary because in the middle of the space was a line of people, winding through dividers. It was maybe hundreds. His heart sank. He felt the old dizziness come over him; the old pounding in the chest. He considered taking a Xanax and being done with it, but decided to wait. He took in a few deep breaths and followed the others to where the line ended.

If he focused on the breathing it wasn't so bad and after a few minutes he couldn't feel his heart pounding anymore, didn't feel dizzy. He felt composed and took in his surroundings. The line was moving fast. At this rate he would be through in another thirty minutes, not bad considering the volume of people. Behind  him now was a line of at least fifty people. This place was odd. It felt makeshift, although there were permanent kiosks set up at the end. All around them were closed stores. He saw a few signs in English, "Duty free!" and "Last chance!" He saw things he recognized which he found strange. A bag of Hershey's Kisses, a Harper's Bazaar magazine, the same stuffed bear he saw at Hartsfield Jackson.

In front of him was a balding man. He was with an attractive woman, blond, shapely. He wondered where they were from and thought about asking them, but decided it would be too awkward to keep up the conversation, too much trouble as he really didn't want to talk to anybody.

"Excuse me," he spoke to the blond, a little too enthusiastically.

"What do you need?" said the man. He put himself between the girl and the man. He sounded German, or Scandinavian.

"What time is it?"

The German pointed to a clock on the wall overhead and turned back around. He stared at his bald head and thought of his own thinning crown. One day his hair would be as bald as this guy's, for sure. The only difference was he would look ridiculous, this guy wore it well. He wondered if the girl had been with him before he was bald, or after. If only you could ask those kinds of questions. Scanning the rest of the crowd it will clear there were people from all over. By far the majority looked South American, but there were a lot of Europeans. Some Americans maybe, maybe Canadian. He kept his eye on an attractive woman a few bends ahead. Ever so often they would cross paths and he would briefly make eye contact. He smiled at her but she did not smile back.

At last he reached the end of the line where there was a small digital sign with red numbers, indicating which kiosk the next person in line should go to. His number flashed fifteen and he walked down to the end, where a customs officer in a dark gray uniform nodded to him. The officer seemed irritated and held out his hand. The man suddenly panicked when he realized he needed the customs paperwork he had filled out on the plane, as well as identification. He was not focused. He took in a deep breath and reached in his pocket but the papers were not there. He reached down for his duffle but the duffle was not there.

The officer said something to him in Spanish, made a gesture with his hand as if he was holding a card.

"I'm sorry," the man said, "do you speak English? I don't know Spanish. My bag is gone. Can I go get it? I need to go find it."

The officer shook his head and leaned back in his chair, looking over to a few kiosks down. He whistled and said someone's name. Another officer came over and spoke to him.

"Sir, where is your id and entry paperworks?"

"That's what I was saying, they're all in my duffle bag and I seemed to have misplaced it somewhere. Maybe on the plane. Can I go get it and return?"

"Sir, we need your identification."

"I know, I'll be right back. Sorry."

He retraced his path through the dividers, past what was by this point hundreds of people. His eyes were fixed on the ground, looking back and forth for his duffle bag. As he went his pace quicker and quickened until he was almost jogging. A young girl in a pink winter coat caught his eye and pointed at him. No sign of the back.

Once past the line of people he broke into a sprint into the corridor leading back to the gates. His heart beat loud in his chest. What would happen if he couldn't find his duffle. All his identification was in there. How could he have left it? Why didn't he pay more attention? He had fucked it all up already. It hadn't even begun and it was fucked up. As his panic increased so did he pace and by that point he was running down the corridor. On the right and left he passed people of all colors, shapes, and sizes, but could not take them in or even acknowledge their amazed looks. A loud whistle echoed from the far end of the corridor. He stopped and glanced back.

A guard with one hand on his mouth and the other on some kind of club gestured violently for him to slow down. The man nodded so the guard could see and resumed walking at a brisk pace.

Eventually he returned to the gates, saw the large numbers and the planes outside. As he passed the bathrooms he remembered going in there and stopped to look. Now there were lots of people but his bag was not there. He looked underneath the stalls and at the very end, he saw the familiar black leather strap dangling down. He went over to the stall and threw open the door.

A kid, maybe fifteen or sixteen was there, sifting through his bag. On the toilet paper rack he could see his checkbook, car keys, and earbuds. The kid was skinny, dressed like a punk, probably Chilean. Without thinking, the man grabbed him by the shirt, ripping it at the collar. He growled,

"What the fuck, man? What do you think you're doing with my stuff? That's my bag you're going through!"

The kid stammered something in Spanish and tried to break free. The man was about to let him go, but a wave of anger went through him and he shoved him hard into the toilet. The kid's back hit the side of the tank and he went down, grabbing himself with both hands. The man was immediately sorry but his anger was still high. He lunged at the kid and the kid scrambled under the stall opening and ran out.

Dizziness overcame him and he sat on the toilet and put his head in his hands. After a few minutes he collected himself and put his things back into the bag. He made sure his ID and paperwork was still there, and then took an itinerary of everything else he could remember bringing. It was all there. He took out his toiletries bag and unzipped it, popping two pills from an orange prescription bottle. He placed them on his tongue and went out to the sink. He turned on the faucet and cupped a handful of water into his mouth, swallowing the pills.

Then he returned to the stall and waited. It took half and hour or so for the Xanax to kick in, and when it did he felt the fear and dizziness subside. A heavy sense of peace and mellowness came over him. He could sleep here if he wanted, but got up and made his way back to customs. He was laughing about everything that happened and didn't even mind waiting in line for another hour. By this time it was eight in the morning and the place was brighter, his mood was brighter.

"Here, the paperwork and my ID," he handed his documents to another kiosk officer. This officer also did not speak much english. The officer nodded and wrote something down on the paper. He stamped his passport and gave it back to him, waving him through to the other side.

This place is like a maze, he thought, rounding another corner, not sure exactly where he was going, but following the general traffic of people. He smelled food somewhere, coffee, sausage, cinnamon rolls. He next entered a cavernous space, with high ceilings, baggage claim conveyers. A female voice came over the speakers in regular intervals spoke something in Spanish, in a calm voice. He found his flight number on the digital panels overhead and walked over to find his checked bag in a stack against the far wall. He wheeled it out and continued through the area, the space congested with crowds of families and businesspeople, couples and patrolling guards with guns in their holsters. He came to the back of a disorganized line, the end of which ended in a panicked crowd of travelers shoving their checked baggage through X-ray machines as officers inspected their contents on tiny monitors to the side.

A Frenchmen pushed into line ahead of him, subtly, using his cell phone conversation as a distraction. The man did not argue. He was not upset, the drugs at maximum effectiveness now. He was relaxed. He even felt proud of himself for not saying anything or reacting in outrage, although he might have only thirty minutes ago. Good stuff, he thought. Someday I have to quit.

As they approached the X-ray machines, a large German Shephard came nosing through the crowd, leading an officer by his leash. The dog sniffed at bags every now and then, sometimes stopping, but most of the time he continued without breaking a stride. When he reached the man's luggage he stopped and sniffed around for a few seconds and the man's gut dropped. Were his prescriptions legal to bring into the country? He really didn't know. Would they confiscate them, arrest him. So many fears went through his mind until the dog continued on his way. The man made eye contact with the dog's officer, who seemed preoccupied and did not return his nod.

He put his bag through the X-ray machine when it was time, and the rubber belt pulled it through the metal box. He watched it go through on the monitor and saw all his belongings in what looked like camera film negative. There was a green outline around the monitor screen, which he took as a good sign, until the officer who sat at the monitor pushed a button to stop the conveyor. A buzzer sounded and a few other officers looked around to see what was happening.

One came over and the other pointed out something to him. They both nodded and looked suspiciously at the man. Even with the sedatives in his system he was panicked and wondered what they had found. The other officer walked to the conveyor and pulled out his luggage. He unzipped it there in front of everyone, exposing his underwear, bag of q-tips, everything. He pushed everything to the side until he found an apple and a box of Cheez-Its. He pulled them out and tossed them into the trash. He then zipped up the luggage and gave the man an impatient glance, pointing to a sign which illustrated no food or produce. He gave a nod to the officer at the monitor who hit another button and the conveyor continued, this time without stopping. He was through.

He rode an escalator up to the main level into the general area of the airport. At the top he went through a crowd of expectant faces, each looking for some other face than his. The smell of food was stronger here and he had not eaten since the night before, so he decided to stop and grab something to eat before heading to the hotel. He found a coffee shop among a row of restaurants and stood in line there, pointing to a cherry danish in the glass and somehow communicating to the girl behind the counter he wanted a medium-sized mocha. He reached the counter and a man gave him the total in Spanish.

"Just take it out of this," he said, handing him the twenty from his wallet.

"No moneda Americano," the man said. He seemed agitated.

"No?"

"No," the man behind the counter repeated, and pointed down the walkway, making a gesture like exchange of money.

"Oh fuck, sorry man," the man said. He took back the twenty and pushed the coffee and danish back into the counter.

The exchange didn't open for another half hour, so the man sat on his bag against the desk. He was exhausted, hungry, and just wanted to get to the hotel so he could get some proper sleep before this afternoon. He took out his phone and checked to see if there was a signal (there wasn't) and then finished listening to a WTF with Marc Maron podcast he had started on the flight. Then he realized his battery was low so turned it off. As he sat there he remembered all his last-minute travel notes were written on the phone's notepad app. So he pulled his journal and pen from his duffle, turned back on the phone, and copied them down, just in case.

By then the exchange was opened, and he exchanged the rest of his pocket money, about a hundred and twenty dollars, for Chilean pesos. He looked at the strange, brightly colored money for a moment before stuffing it in his wallet. He returned to the coffee shop but there was a line so he said screw it and decided to head to the hotel instead.

Outside it was even colder than he remembered from this morning, overcast and windy. An old man was spraying down the walkway outside the automatic doors and some overspray him in the face. He gave the old man a nasty look and went down a ways to a line of yellow taxis, all the drivers leaned on their vehicles, waiting for customers.

"Hey man, need a lift?" one of the driver's said. He was the only one who spoke English so he gave him a nod and handed him his luggage. The driver jumped up, threw the luggage in the trunk and opened the door for the man. Once inside he asked, "Where would you like to go?" with such a strong accent and trouble articulating the words it was obvious he only knew enough English for business reasons. But it was enough.

"180 Miraflores, cross street with Moneda. Here," he handed him the notes he had jotted into his journal earlier, and pointed to the address.

"Ah, Hotel Riveria, si" The driver gave him a thumbs up, put down the fare flag, and took off.

Once far enough away, the man turned back and took in the entire airport. It was an impressive sight, the giant metal and glass structure, futuristic in that thirty year old way.

The driver weaved in and out of the traffic like a man on a mission. He made no attempt at small talk, but this was fine with him. It would have been impossible anyway. So instead, he looked out the window, a wave of relief coming over him. 

He had a moment of weakness back there, he had actually taken some Xanax. It had been a couple months since the last time. He knew it would be this way. And it was. He felt good. Thankfully he had done as his mother suggested and got the prescription filled the day he told her he was leaving. Just the Xanax and Ambien, short term stuff. No Lexapro, he didn't need a long-term solution, just a safety net. Fuck, why did he shove that poor kid? That kid probably had shit his pants. Hell, he nearly shit his. That was not him back there. Not him at all.

He saw outside the cars going by. Cars he did not recognize, smaller and older than those on the American highways. Inside were Chileans. Life here was the same as in the states. Going to work, going home. The buildings were the same, not exactly, but close enough. Old ones, shiny new ones. Dilapidated ones. Graffiti on the concrete overpass. In Spanish of course. Green signs in Spanish, roads, exits. The smells the same, gasoline, the crisp, almost metallic winter air. A gray light, overcast, maybe a little chance of rain. The people different, native, more ancient looking, shorter. He saw them walking on the sidewalks. 

Beyond the city he saw the mountains, the Andes. How far was it there, to those snowy peaks? He imagined the silence of that place in contrast to the noise down here. He was sitting there in the snow, cross-legged, he ankles exposed and freezing. The cold of the snow slowly coming through the bottom of his jeans. He shivered. The only sound here was the whipping of the wind around the crags. No life nor food. Only silence. This was no place for a human being.

He awoke still in the taxi, the driver stopped in construction traffic, frustrated and banging on the steering wheel. It was raining. Outside were people walking past, making better time than the cars. It took him a few moments to realize he was in Chile, took some time before the events of the morning came back to him. He reached into his duffle bag and pulled out his journal. Between two pages was a folded photograph. He opened it and gazed at the dark-haired woman staring back at him. She was beautiful.


Chapter Two

Curled up inside the doorway to the Hotel Riviera, a gray mutt of some kind lay oblivious to the world, preventing the old doors from opening fully. The man was soaked through by this point and had his duffle stacked on top of his luggage, which was being wheeled behind him. A stream of water fell down over the green fabric overhang of the entrance onto his bag. The man pushed hard against the door and slid the dog out of the way with it. He then twirled his luggage around and pushed them through the door first, holding the door with one hand.

Inside, the foyer was cramped with archways separating the different areas. Its decor was out of fashion by a few decades, wooden accents, paintings of ships and European beaches, dim lighting everywhere. The tiled floors were slick with rain, so the man went carefully over to the front desk. A couple was ahead of him, speaking to the hotel clerk. They argued in Spanish, and then the male customer finally threw his hands up and signed a sheet of paper. When he turned around to leave he made eye contact with the man, and rolled his eyes. The man nodded. When he approached the desk he pulled out a sheet of paper, where he had translated what he needed to tell the clerk.

"Hola, mi nombre es William S y tengo una habitaci√≥n reservada para esta noche hasta el mi√©rcoles," he read with emphasis on each word.

"Reservation you say?"

"Yes, good, you speak English. I didn't know."

The clerk nodded, "Si. Let me find your reservation."

He flipped through a small notepad on the counter.

"Mr. S?"

"Yes, that's me." the man smiled.

"We have no Mr. S with reservation. Did you mean Sloan? We have a Sloan."

"No, you should have a reservation. I wrote an email just yesterday. In Spanish. Said I was coming into the city today. Mr. S, staying through Wednesday. I received a response from a lady. I printed it out. Here."

He handed the clerk the printout. The clerk took it, read thoughtfully, and turned to a lady on the other side of the desk. They talked for some time, flipping through more papers, and finally the clerk turned back to him.

"Mr. S, we have no copy of your reservation but would be happy to rent you a room. Would you like a room?"

"Please," the man said, and then added, "at the rate you quoted in the email, $75 a night?"

The clerk frowned.

"Unfortunately, sir, we do not have any more rooms at that rate. We have a double bed room for $120 American dollars a night, is that okay?"

"Fine, that's fine."

A young boy took his luggage and walked him over to a small elevator in the back corner hallway. He put down the bags and pushed the only button. "Cinco," he said, and then wandered off. The man looked at his key, the number 512 in gold letters. Eventually a rickety platform came down and stopped. The man slid open the wooden door and wheeled his luggage into the space. He pressed the 5 button and the lift shuttered and squeaked then took him up.

The room was clean and small. It had two twin beds with a tiny shelf between them. A clock radio on the shelf blinked 12:32 am. He turned on his phone and checked the time, 11:18 am. The battery was on red so he pulled out the plug and discovered the outlets were different. "One more fucking thing," he said, turning off the phone. He set the time on the clock radio and set the alarm for 3 pm. Then he pulled back the thin sheets and blanket and curled up in them, kicking off his shoes onto the floor.

The alarm woke him at 3 and he rose and immediately opened his laptop. It still had an hour or so. He found the wifi and connected, no password required. He opened his email and reread the last email from Constanza:

Hey babe, glad you decided to come! You so crazy (in a good way ;-) I know you won't have phone when you get here, but maybe send an email from the hotel? If I don't hear from you let's just meet up at Juan Valdez in Providencia at 1730. Can't wait to meet you in person finally, so we can have one of our deep conversations face to face. C

PS - I'm super nervous! xoxoxo

He replied:

The eagle has landed! In Chile as we speak (write). I told you I would make it happen. This is just to let you know I'm here and can make it to Juan Valdez by 1730 no problem. I will see you there, D

PS - I'm nervous too! @-->---

He undressed, grabbed his toiletries bag, his travel towel, and went to the bathroom. As he flipped the light switch a loud flash popped and the bathroom went dark. He fumbled around for the shower and eventually figured out a medium temperature. He got in the shower and bathed in the dim light that came in from outside. After, he pulled out his nice jeans and a dark striped button up, white t-shirt, his nice leather shoes. Fortunately there was a mirror in his toiletries bag, so he used that to floss his teeth and fix his hair.

Downstairs he approached the same clerk who checked him in and asked if he knew any stores that sold US socket adapters and also a place that sold flowers. The clerk nodded and walked around the desk. He led the man outside, where it had stopped raining. He took him by the hand and led him to the curb, traffic bumper to bumper. He pointed down to the end of Miraflores.

"See, there the intersection, look for Merced. There is a Lider. In there you can buy some flowers. For adapters, maybe head down Moneda to the market side streets. Good?"

Will nodded, but then asked, "Well, if down Moneda has a marketplace, do I need to go to the Lider? It might save me walking if I can get both in the same place."

"Do what you like, my friend. I think you will be okay," the clerk said, somewhat agitated. I need to get back to the desk."

He walked back to the hotel, but tripped over an elderly man sitting against the building. The man had only one leg, but it was extended into the walkway. He held out a styrofoam cup with a few coins in it. The clerk lost his temper and cursed at the old man, who just stared at his insults. Eventually the clerk went back into the hotel. Will felt sorry for the crippled man, and wanted to help him, but felt ashamed. He didn't know why.

Will decided to try his luck down Moneda, so took off that way, making sure he noted the direction he came from so he could find his way back. There were crowds of people, businessmen mostly, attractive women. Traffic everywhere. He passed a large church next to a large government building. He noticed certain intersections were only for pedestrian traffic, and they even had red lights and green lights. He turned down one of these side streets, Ahumeda and found a small electronics store. Luckily he had remembered to bring his plug and just showed it to the man behind the counter. The man went to the back and returned with a black adapter and that was that. Will handed him the largest Chilean bill he had and that seemed to cover it, with change back. He continued down the street, looking for a place that might sell flowers. He also glanced around for a clock but couldn't find one, so he stopped a lady going the opposite direction and tapped his wrist as if asking for the time.

"Las cuatro y media," she replied.

"English?"

"No," she shook her head and then went on.

He walked down the street, passing store after store, hundreds of people. His breathing shallower and shallower, until he had to stop and collect himself against a large movie advertisement, Cars 2. He breathed deep and slowly the dizziness passed. His heart rate returned to normal.

At last he came to another Lider, the same store the hotel clerk had mentioned, and walked in. Like most grocery stores, it had a familiar layout. But he couldn't find any section with flowers. He approached a worker stocking pizza crusts and spoke to him in English.

"Hey, can you help me find flowers? I'm in kind of a hurry."

"Que?" the man asked.

"Flowers, pretty flowers."

"Engles?"

"Si, English. Can you show me to the flowers, if you have any?"

"Si," the man said. He rose and led him over two isles to the baked goods. There the worker pointed to five and ten pound bags of flour.

"Flour" he said.

"Si," Will said, "Gracias. Gracias"

The worker smiled and walked off.

Will continued walking the isles until finally he spotted a little stand with some potted plants and flowers. He picked out bunch of red and yellow flowers in a pot, bought the entire pot and tossed it and the soil outside the store. 

He carried the flowers in one hand and the bag with the adapters in the other and decided to try to reach Providencia by Metro. He pulled out the small guide book the hotel provided and found the Metro map. The nearest station was Santa Lucia, back in the direction of Hotel Riviera. He quickened his pace and using the map, found his way back to Moneda, then up to the Santa Lucia metro entrance.

It was not too much trouble to get the metro pass, a plastic card with BIP! written in bold yellow letters. He loaded the card up with ten thousand pesos, scanned it at the gate and descended to the platform with a red sign that listed all the stops in the western direction: Universidad Catolica, Baquedano,  Salvador, Manuel Montt, Pedro De Valdivia, and Los Leones, the stop he wanted, according to the map. After a few minutes the silver train rumbled to a stop in front of him and dozens of passengers exited, while dozens more tried to get on. He squeezed on just before the doors pulled shut and a female voice came on the intercom. He stood in a pack of people, most looking at their cell phones. The train pulled away from the platform and Will watched the people outside go by in an increasing blur. Then the tunnel. Fifteen minutes later he was in Los Leones.

He followed the other passengers up the stairs around the bend to one of the exits, there were signs but he wasn't sure if it was the right one. He passed a small bakery inside and the aroma of fresh bread reminded him he hadn't eaten since he arrived earlier this morning. He went up the steps to the street and took out the street map the hotel had provided. He had marked the location of the Juan Valdez on it, and the Los Leones metro. The problem was there appeared to be two exits to the station and he couldn't easily tell which he had emerged from. He walked around the crowds to the street signs and traced them on the map, but the street he was on wasn't on the map. Finally he got frustrated and stopped a man in a suit.

"Hola, donde es Juan Valdez?" he asked, surprised he had remembered enough to articulate a complete thought in Spanish.

The man pointed behind him and said something Will did not comprehend, but that was at least something to go on.

"Si, si. Gracias!"

"De nada."

Will continued down the way the man had told him, still unsure where he was. He stopped to ask another passerby what time it was. 1645. Good. He still had plenty of time. Even so, with the crowds of people and the traffic and the stress of finding the place, he could feel the dizziness and disconnected feeling coming on. He took in a few breaths and told himself to calm down, but it didn't do much good. It was too early to take another Xanax, he had already broke his rule and taken two at the airport this morning. Better to suffer through this, but maybe he would take one before Constanza arrived, to get back in the zone.

The streets around him were shadowed by the looming office buildings and upper class department stores. Most were unfamiliar but he recognized a few, Perry Ellis, Armani. The sun was dropping below the skyline, and every so often it would appear between the cracks and briefly blind the crowd, their hands held up to their eyes in unison. He passed restaurants and cafes. The food smelled fresh and good. Maybe he would take Constanza out for a nice dinner. In the rush he hadn't even thought of what they could do. He only thought about seeing her in person. Coffee, dinner, a walk in the park. Maybe the one close to the Hotel Rivieria he had seen. A smile came over his face. It was good to be here, he thought. A bold move for sure.

A few more turns and directions from passersby later he arrived at an open square, with italian restaurant tucked in the back corner and to the right the Juan Valdez coffee shop. He went inside and asked the barista what time it was, 1700. Good. He looked in the glass display and pointed to a bright red fruit drink and also grabbed a croissant	 with butter. He found a comfortable spot upstairs with a good view of the entrance so he wouldn't miss Constanza arriving. He popped a Xanax and drank it down the fruit drink. The drink was way too sweet, like syrup. He winced and walked down to the bar and asked for agua. They gave him a premium bottled water and he couldn't figure out how to ask for tap water, so he paid for it and returned upstairs.

Juan Valdez was nice enough, a chain obviously, comparable to Starbucks in the States, although he had seen a few of those along the way too. Will wasn't much of a coffee drinker but the croissant was good, warm, freshly made. The patrons seemed like college students, upper class businessmen and women meeting after work. A girl close to him was typing into a Macbook and listening to something poppy in her headphones, he could almost hear the tune.

Fifteen minutes later he could feel the Xanax take effect, something like sinking into a warm mud bath. He closed his eyes and listened to the Spanish rock music they had playing over the speakers. Today it was okay to take the Xanax, but today only. Last minute travel to foreign country to see a woman he had never met certainly qualified as a stressor, if anything did. He  scanned the downstairs one time to make sure she had not yet arrived. They should have arranged a signal of some kind, like a flower on her shirt or something. Knowing someone from a photo is quite a different thing from recognizing them in person. He had been on enough online dates to know that. But he was sure it wouldn't be too hard to spot Constanza. Her picture was honest. Good lighting, a square angle. She had nothing to hide from the camera that's for sure.

He asked the girl next to him what time it was, 1745. He walked downstairs and scanned the floor, but did not see her. Just then a girl walked through the entrance he thought was her, but it wasn't. He must have been staring too intently at the customers as they all seemed to stop what they were doing and stare back at him. He pretended he was checking his phone (although it was turned off) and walked outside to look around. By now the streets were bathed in twilight, the lights from the storefronts still open giving off a glow. There were only a few tables outside and she was not here either. He went back inside, upstairs and waited.

Half an hour later, Will was wondering if he should try to find a computer, or head back to the hotel to check his email there. It was dark outside. He walked down to the barista and asked the time, 1840. Even with the sedative in his system he was anxious. He didn't want to blow this meetup. It was almost perfect, if she'd just get here already. He pulled the photograph from his pocket and showed it to the barista, then gestured to the cafe. The barista leaned in to get a good look at the photo and then looked up at Will, smiling. Will again swept the room with a gesture as if asking if he had seen her there. The barista slowly grinned and shook his head. He said something, a name, that Will did not recognize.

"Constanza," he said, pointing to the photograph.

The barista laughed, "Ana Tijoux, si!" He whistled at his coworkers down the line - they walked over. He asked Will for the photo, showed them, then started acting like he was singing into a microphone. One of the girls looked up at Will and giggled. "Ana Tijoux," they repeated to each other and laughed.

"Who's Ana Tijoux, are you saying that's the girl in the picture? What are you saying?"

The baristas looked at him and then a younger guy ran in back and brought back a tablet, punched in a few keys and handed it to Will. There, unmistakable, was Constanza, rapping in a YouTube video. It had a few million views. "Ana Tijoux, love her" read the top comment. Will typed Ana Tijoux in the search box and switched to the images tab. There he saw dozens of photos of Ana Tijoux, Chilean pop artist with French ancestry. Lots of the photos were slick and glossy with obvious retouches, but there were a few candid ones, her looking like a normal girl, and towards the bottom of the screen he saw his own photo of Ana, Constanza. His heart sank.

Will handed back the tablet to the barista and walked out into the street. The crowds had thinned and the square was silent for the moment, a distant honking. He walked in the direction he thought his hotel was in but did not consult the map. Before he realized it he was looking at the Pedro De Valdivia metro entrance but passed it by. He felt like he needed to breath in the cool evening air and couldn't conceive of going down where he had no air to breathe. He passed more restaurants but was no longer hungry. A sick, hollow feeling in his stomach replaced the hunger. A few dogs in a pack hurried past as if they were headed somewhere important, then turned a corner onto a side street. Will followed them just to have something outside his own thoughts to focus on. The lead dog was larger than the rest and wore a tattered vest of some kind. It looked warm.

The dogs came to a restaurant called the Hotel California, where the smell of grilled meat and the sound of clinking mugs of beer and loud music swirled through the street outside. The dogs ducked into a small space between the restaurant and disappeared. Will stopped at the entrance and looked inside. There was a game on the big screen TV and people laughing and smoking at the bar. Upstairs he saw a couple cuddling against the window.
