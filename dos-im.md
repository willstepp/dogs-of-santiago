W, you have added C as a friend.

C: Hi
W: Hi
C: What are you doing tonight?
W: Nothing much...who is this?
C: Who do you think it is?
W: Um, I don't know, hence the question.
C: I saw your profile on PlentyOfFish. You mentioned your IM name.
W: Oh, I see. What made you write?
C: Your handsome smile.
W: :-)
C: ...

C: I'm a GIRL!!! :-P
W: haha
C: ...
C: ...
W: Sorry, I was a little busy...
C: Oh, we don't have to talk. Sorry to bother you.
W: Not bothering me, just finishing up some work.
C: 


What do you see out the window? Their thing.

First conversation, Will wants to see a photo, but she won't give one. Wants them first to get to know each other without the superficial. "I have the upper hand." If she decides he is worthy of her, she will send a photo. "I guess you will have to wait and see." Then the initial chapter ends with him pulling out the photo and a description of it, into the next conversation, which opens with 'their' thing, describing what's out of the nearest window.

Maybe he resists the temptation with his anxiety to take any medication, and what pushes him over the edge is when Constanza isn't who she claims to be.

There was something in the suffering of the old man's face that caused everything else to recede into the background, even Constanza, the mystery there, and he felt that to help him in some small way, if he did that, whatever thing that was in him that felt out of balance would be restored, whatever that made him feel restless and uneasy would go away. The darkness of the previous night would be wiped away.

Don't explain too much, just describe it like a compulsion, an unconscious thing.
